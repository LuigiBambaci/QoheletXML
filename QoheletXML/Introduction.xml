        <head type="title">The Goals</head>
        <p>
            The aim of our work is threefold:
            <list type="enumerate">
                <item>an exhaustive collation of the variants to the Hebrew Qohelet (<abbr>Qoh</abbr>)</item>
                <item>a critical text which mirrors the Author’s Original</item>
                <item>a digital database of variants encoded pursuant to the international standards of the <hi rend="italics">Text Encoding Initiative</hi></item>
            </list>
        </p>
        <p>
            The collation is based on a systematic <term>recensio</term> of the documentation, 
            carried out by comparing the Masoretic text (<abbr>M</abbr>) with the most important witnesses, 
            both in Hebrew and in translation. 
            The collation aims at comprehensiveness: 
            in comparing <abbr>M</abbr> with the textual witnesses, 
            we set ourselves the goal of recording everything that may constitute <hi xml:lang="lat">prima facie</hi> textual variation.
            The decision as to the authenticity of such variants we leave to our textual commentary, 
            and only those variants considered as authentic are taken into account for the constitution of the critical text.
        </p>
        <p>
            The critical text is the incarnation of our reconstruction of the Original. 
            The edition is therefore <term>eclectic</term>:
            readings we consider superior are embodied  in the text, 
            while secondary variants are placed in the apparatus. 
            The reconstruction of the Original is an ideal goal of the critical-textual enterprise but, as such, is not always attainable. 
            Whenever we feel that the reading of the Original is not attainable in a particular case, 
            we reproduce verbatim the reading from the Archetype, that is, 
            the reading that we feel best explains the genesis of the competing readings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The present work, from this Introduction to the Bibliography, has been written entirely in <abbr>XML</abbr>-<abbr>TEI</abbr> language. 
            The encoding has allowed us to render the text and its variants not only machine-readable, but also machine-actionable: 
            through the addition of specific tags for each relevant textual element (verse, apparatus, reading, witness <term>siglum</term>, etc.), 
            we have succeeded in obtaining, from a single file encoded in <abbr>XML</abbr>-<abbr>TEI</abbr>,
            both the collation and the critical text with the apparatus of variants. 
            The resulting encoded text is available at our Github address

            <head type="title">Why a New Critical Edition of Qohelet?</head>
            <p>
                Three projects towards a critical edition of the Hebrew Bible (<abbr>HB</abbr>) are ongoing:  
                the <hi xml:lang="lat">Biblia Hebraica</hi> series (<abbr>BH</abbr>),
                the <hi rend="italics">Hebrew University Bible</hi> (<abbr>HUB</abbr>), and
                the <hi rend="italics">Hebrew Bible: A Critical Edition</hi> (<abbr>HBCE</abbr>).                
            </p>            
            <p>
                The currently existing editions of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> in particular are also three in number, and they are all part of the <abbr>BH</abbr> series:
                the first in chronological order is Kittel's <hi xml:lang="lat">Biblia Hebraica</hi> (<abbr>BHK</abbr>)
                edited by <ref target="#Driver1905">22</ref>,
                followed by the <abbr>BH<hi rend="sup">3</hi></abbr> by <ref target="#Horst1937"/> and
                the <hi xml:lang="lat">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</hi> (<abbr>BHS</abbr>) by <ref target="#Horst1997"/>,
                and culminating with the <hi xml:lang="lat">Biblia Hebraica Quinta</hi> (<abbr>BHQ</abbr>) edited by <ref target="#Goldman2004"/>.               
            </p>
            <p>
                As compared to previous editions, our work can claim the following four elements of originality:
                <list type="enumerate">
                    <item>It is based on a comprehensive aggregation of variants.</item>
                    <item>It includes new data, particularly from the Greek and medieval Hebrew traditions.</item>
                    <item>It contains an eclectic edition, with a proposed reconstruction of the Original text.</item>
                    <item>It is entirely realised in digital format.</item>
                </list>
                In what follows, we will discuss each of these points in detail, 
                seeking to emphasise those aspects which, we believe, 
                distinguish ours from previous similar works. 
                Finally, we will make a few clarifications regarding limitations and shortcomings, 
                suggesting possible avenues for research on the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> text as well as for its digital edition.      
            </p>
            <div type="subsection">
                <head type="title">An Extensive Collation</head>
                <p>
                    The gathering of variants that we present here is, to our knowledge, 
                    the most extensive ever assembled for the Hebrew text of Qoh. 
                    Indeed, we believe that ours is <hi rend="italics">the first ever collation of Qoh in the technical sense of that term</hi>:
                    a collection, that is, as systematic as possible, of all possible instances of textual variation. 
                    The collections now found in critical editions of the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> are, 
                    precisely because they appear in critical editions, selective, 
                    whereas those found in the literature are in the form of commentaries and often focus only on this or that tradition –
                    the Greek and Syriac in particular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, by contrast, we have wanted to bring together in a single place all of the instances of variation that we have been able to identify, 
                    both through direct comparison with the sources and by consulting the works of scholars who preceded us, 
                    from the primary literature (the other critical editions) as well as the secondary literature (commentaries, articles, monographs).
                </p>                
                <p>
                    For each place of variation, we have collected the readings of the witnesses examined,
                    citing them in their respective original languages and translating them when necessary in the commentary. 
                    In this way, we have sought to spare the reader the necessity of having to consult the texts of such witnesses – 
                    an exercise that is often unavoidable with modern editions, which, for obvious reasons of space, 
                    are forced to limit the citation in their apparatuses of readings in the original languages.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    To unfurl the textual evidence, we have divided the readings into groups according to their similarity: 
                    for each place of variation, the witnesses sharing the same reading,
                    and so presumably depending on the same <term>Vorlage</term>, 
                    have been placed together in the same groups so as to highlight instances of agreement and disagreement. 
                    This grouping system is inspired by that of the <abbr>BHQ</abbr> 
                    and is designed as a tool for analysing the genealogical relationships among the various witnesses:
                    the resulting groupings are discussed in the textual commentary, and we make use of them when evaluating the variants for the fixation of the original text.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The collation has been carried out according to some general criteria which we have imposed upon ourselves. 
                    In the existing editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, little space, if any,
                    is devoted to describing the process of collating variants.
                    And yet, this is a crucial step in the case of a polyglot tradition such as the <abbr>HB</abbr>, 
                    for which variants do not offer themselves to the scholar with the same <quote>immediacy</quote> as they do in monolingual textual traditions. 
                    In establishing criteria for collation, we have wanted to prepare a guide that would be useful first and foremost to ourselves, 
                    helping us to extricate authentic variants from the vast corpus of direct and indirect sources, 
                    but also useful to the reader in understanding how such variants were chosen. 
                    During the collection process, as well as while evaluating the variants and their retroversions, 
                    we have aimed not at an impossible objectivity, which does not exist in historical investigation, but rather at a kind of intersubjectivity:
                    that is, we have tried to indicate explicitly the criteria we have applied each time to justify our choices, 
                    so as to allow for inter-subjective control on the part of the reader.
                    In the apparatus underlying the critical text, we indicate those variants that, at the end of the collation and evaluation phase, 
                    we consider as sufficiently certain: 
                    in this way we render transparent to the reader the entire workflow, 
                    from the identification of the variants in the primary sources, 
                    to their selection as a channel leading to the reconstruction of the critical text.

                <head type="title">An Updated Collation</head>
                <p>
                    As compared to the most recent edition of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, by <ref target="#Goldman2004"/>,
                    ours is distinguished by the use of more up-to-date material. 
                    In the absence of a critical edition of the Greek translation, 
                    Goldman was compelled to resort to <ref target="#Field1875"/>'s work with regard to the fragments of the Revisors (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion), 
                    and to the <term>editio critica minor</term> by Rahlfs and the eighteenth-century collation by <ref target="#Holmes1823"/> with regard to the Septuagint.
                    Meanwhile, the critical edition of the hexaplaric fragments, edited by <ref target="#Marshall2007"/>, 
                    and the <term>editio critica maior</term> of the Septuagint, edited by <ref target="#Gentry2019"/>, have been published. 
                    We have taken account of both in our work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is in fact an important editorial innovation for the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> text: 
                    Holmes and Parson's collation is obviously dated, while Rahlfs' critical edition, 
                    besides being based on a small number of textual witnesses, 
                    is coloured by an excessive recourse to the <hi xml:lang="lat">Commentarius</hi> of St.\ Jerome as a source for Old Latin, 
                    which causes him to favour those Greek readings that are closest to <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                    even when these have little or no support in the manuscript tradition.                    
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Gentry's critical edition represents a major step forward in the reconstruction of the Greek original
                    and is based on a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of data that includes, not least,
                    the recently discovered manuscript 788, 
                    which is also fundamental to the tradition of the hexaplaric fragments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another original aspect to our work relates to the medieval codices of the Hebrew text. 
                    For these, the mediation of Kennicott's and De Rossi's classical collations is still obligatory, 
                    and so we too have made use of them. 
                    However, we have also collated altogether new codices, 
                    as well as entirely re-collated around 60 of the codices examined by Kennicott. 
                    For the Babylonian tradition, we have made use of the very recent work by <ref target="#Miletto2022"/>.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Finally, we have had access to a much more up-to-date secondary literature, 
                    among which we might mention the numerous articles by Gentry, cited in the bibliography, 
                    on the textual history and textual criticism of the Greek version, as well as, in particular, 
                    the two-volume commentary by Weeks (<ref target="#Weeks2020"/>, <ref target="#Weeks2022"/>), the most exhaustive not only as regards exegesis, 
                    but also as to the gathering and evaluation of textual variants.

                   There are several eclectic editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr> that propose a critical text reconstruction. 
                   The earliest and best known are the editions of Ezekiel by <ref target="#Cornill1886b"/> and of Samuel by <ref target="#Wellhausen1871"/>,

               <p>
                   None of the editions or publishing projects mentioned above includes <abbr>Qoh</abbr>: 
                   the Polychrome Bible volume that was to include <abbr>Qoh</abbr> (the sixteenth) never saw the light of day,
                   while a volume for <abbr>Qoh</abbr> is currently planned for the HBCE. 
                   The editions currently available for <abbr>Qoh</abbr> are all diplomatic editions with an apparatus of variants:
                   <ref target="#Driver1905"/> prints the <term>textus receptus</term> from the Second Rabbinic Bible, whereas other, 
                   later editions of the <abbr>BH</abbr> series print the text of the Leningrad Codex (<abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>).
               </p>
               <p>
                   Editing a biblical text on an eclectic model poses several challenges, 
                   first and foremost that of defining the exact nature and purpose of the critical text, 
                   as well as the criteria leading to its constitution: 
                   What in fact does the critical text really represent? 
                   What does the editor aim to achieve through it? 
                   On what basis does the reconstruction take place?
                   The editor of an eclectic text has to take decisions not only on the reconstruction of points considered to be corrupted,
                   but also on those portions of the text that are not affected at all by variants, 
                   or for which the attested variants are of equal value: 
                   which reading should be published in the case of an absence or equivalence of variants? 
                   How to justify such a choice? And how to deal with spelling, vocalisation, and accentuation? 
                   Finally, the editor of an eclectic text is obliged to take a position with respect to every single variant he comes upon: 
                   the constraint of the critical text compels him to make precise choices regarding the originality of individual variants and,
                   in the absence of arguments for or against a certain variant,
                   to declare <hi rend="italics">explicitly</hi> that a choice is impossible.
                   Neither of these problems imposes itself with the same force in the case of a diplomatic edition: 
                   by relying on the text of an edition or manuscript considered authoritative, 
                   the editor of a diplomatic text is not obliged to confront problems of spelling, vocalisation, and accentuation, 
                   let alone pass judgement on all the variants he identifies. 
                   Indeed, the primary purpose and ultimate goal of a diplomatic edition has remained,
                   since the time of Bédier, the detection of copy-text errors and their correction,
                   and the <abbr>HB</abbr> is no exception.
               </p>
               <p>
                   In reconstructing our critical text, we have attempted to address the problems we have just outlined,
                   adopting whatever solutions we believe to be optimal. 
                   These we submit to the judgement of the benevolent reader. 
                   Some of the choices we have made are debatable in theory, and all are improvable in practice: 
                   we are fully aware that these are incursions into a terrain, 
                   that of <abbr>HB</abbr> eclectic ecdotics, which remains in large part untrodden territory even today.

                    There are several digital versions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, available both on the net, 
                    such as biblehub
                    <note type="foot">
                        <seg type="url">https://biblehub.com/</seg>  (accessed 31 January 2023).
                    </note>, 
                    and in well-known commercial software such as Bibleworks, Accordance, and Logos. 
                    These versions show the Hebrew text (usually <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> in the <abbr>BHS</abbr> transcription) 
                    accompanied by that of the most important translations (especially the Greek and Latin),
                    but they are not critical, as they lack an apparatus of variants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deserving to be called critical are instead the digital versions of paper editions such as the <abbr>BHS</abbr> and <abbr>BHQ</abbr>,
                    made available in special modules in the aforementioned software. 
                    These editions, however, are realised in languages and technologies –
                    presumably, relational databases – 
                    that are <quote>hidden</quote> from the end user: 
                    the data entered in these editions cannot be queried by the user
                    outside the graphical interface of the respective software, and, above all, cannot be extracted, 
                    due to the proprietary nature of such software, and reused, due to copyright. 
                    A different choice was made by the publishers of the <abbr>HBCE</abbr>, who opted for a non-<abbr>TEI</abbr> proprietary <abbr>XML</abbr> language. 
                    Of this edition, produced within the CEDAR project, there is, however, still nothing actually published,
                    and it is not clear from the releases issued so far
                    <note type="foot">

                    </note> whether 
                    and to what extent the publishers plan to make the encoding of the primary data open-access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to the digital editions mentioned above, our edition is distinguished by being,
                    to the best of our knowledge, <hi rend="italics">the first born-digital edition of a biblical book in Hebrew</hi>, 
                    encoded in TEI and designed to be distributed in open-access.
                </p>             
                <p>
                    The reasons that led us to opt for a digital edition, and to choose a markup language for this purpose, 
                    are mainly two: the possibility that such a language offers to dynamically compose a multiplicity of texts and editions, 
                    and the desire to offer data encoded according to an international standard, 
                    which can be shared and reused by other scholars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The potential that the use of a markup language offers for scholarly editing is manifold. 
                    We have made use of encoding to put in black and white the discrete steps of the philological method we will discuss in Section <ptr target="#chap-method"/>,
                    from the collection of variants and their evaluation to the constitution of the critical text. 
                    Starting with a single file containing the primary data (the Hebrew text of the Leningrad codex, 
                    the readings deduced from the tradition, and those deduced from the secondary literature) 
                    and our annotations of that data (the characterisations of the variants and the editorial judgements), 
                    the encoding has allowed us to obtain two editions of the same text, which are the ones we present to the reader here:
                    the collation on the one hand, and the critical text with apparatus on the other.
                    This approach to digital scholarly editing as a <quote>data overview</quote> has a particular relevance in the case of the <abbr>HB</abbr>'s ecdotics,
                    insofar as it offers an example of how the digital medium permits strongly opposing ecdotic models,
                    such as the diplomatic and the eclectic, to coexist: 
                    the juxtaposition of a diplomatic text with variants (our collation), on the one hand, 
                    and a critical text with apparatus (our eclectic edition), on the other, is also meant to be a demonstration of this.
                </p>             
                <p>
                    The other reason that has prompted us to adopt a markup language such as <abbr>TEI</abbr> stems, as we have stated,
                    from the desire to make data freely accessible and modifiable. 
                    One of the inspiring principles of <abbr>TEI</abbr>
                    is not only to offer a tool that allows interaction between text and machine,
                    but also to make available to scholars a common vocabulary for encoding the various textual phenomena of interest,
                    as well as to prepare the encoded texts for the use of shared tools,
                    such as those for digital publication like <abbr>TEI</abbr>-Publisher, which are precisely based on <abbr>TEI</abbr>. 
                    A critical edition encoded in <abbr>TEI</abbr> is designed to be shared by multiple users, 
                    who can use the encoding to extract data of interest or to interrogate it and take it as a starting point for other research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By choosing to adopt a <hi xml:lang="lat">de facto</hi> standard such as <abbr>TEI</abbr>,
                    we have wished to adhere intentionally to the inspiring principles of this meritorious initiative,
                    convinced of the importance of free access to data for scientific research 
                    as well as the adoption of a common digital language for encoding philological phenomena. 
                    The codified text, which we make available on our Github, 
                    can be downloaded and the data in it corrected, expanded, and freely reused for further investigation. 
                    The encoding scheme we have chosen for our edition may serve, if nothing else, 
                    as an initial example and as a possible model for future digital critical editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>.

               <head type="title">Limits and Perspectives</head>
               <p>
                   After pointing out what we believe to be the elements of originality of our work, 
                   and before moving on to describe in detail the object of our philological reconstruction,
                   it seems only fair to specify what our edition is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> and what the reader should not expect from it.
               </p>
                <p>
                    It is above all important to emphasise that our work is
                    <hi rend="italics"> a study of textual criticism, and not of the history of the tradition</hi>. 
                    We review the various textual witnesses and arrange them in groups on the basis of commonality, 
                    but only for the purpose of constituting the critical text: we do not make the analysis of the relationships between witnesses a study in itself,
                    nor do we construct a <term>stemma codicum</term> based on such relationships 
                    <note type="foot">As has been done admirably, for example, by <ref target="#Hendel1998"/>
                        for the text of Genesis 1-11, and by <ref target="#Catastini1995"/>,
                        who devotes an entire volume to the history of the tradition of Genesis 37-50 and the constitution of a <term>stemma codicum</term>,
                    and another to the actual critical edition with commentary, 
                    see note <ptr target="#notaCatastini"/>.</note>. 
                    Personally, we believe that the study of the history of the tradition is fundamental and preliminary to textual criticism; 
                    however, in the case of a book such as <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, we consider it not obligatory and feel 
                    that its absence does not block the path towards a critical edition, for two reasons. 
                    First, the relationships between the various witnesses have long been defined by critics: a renewed study of the entire issue,
                    although it might possibly shed light on particular cases, would be unlikely, in our opinion, to radically alter our judgement on the subject. 
                    Second, it is doubtful that a <term>stemma</term> can be useful as a tool for making decisions as to the originality of variants: 
                    as we shall have occasion to state yet again (§ <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>), 
                    the biblical tradition is essentially a bipartite and notoriously contaminated tradition, 
                    so that decisions as to which reading is to be preferred will almost always fall to internal criteria
                    and must in any event be arrived at on a case-by-case basis. 
                    As far as we are concerned here, we believe that the act of combining what we already know about the relationships between the various witnesses,
                    together with the information present in each place of variation, is sufficient for purposes of constituting the critical text,
                    which is our ultimate aim here. 
                    A study of the history of the tradition of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> may well be undertaken separately in the future,
                    and would benefit hugely, as argued above, from a digital encoding of the data.
                </p>               
               <p>
                   A few comments are also in order regarding the collection of variants. 
                   Although we have aimed for comprehensiveness, we do not claim to have exhausted all possible variants for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>: 
                   the variants that can be collected for the <abbr>HB</abbr> are potentially infinite, 
                   if one takes into account all of the traditions through which its text has been handed down, 
                   as well as the presence of many apparent variants due to translation. 
                   The collation criteria we have imposed upon ourselves have been necessary in order to eliminate noise from the data,
                   but it cannot be excluded that, along with the noise, potentially authentic variants have been excluded as well.
                   Some variants may have simply slipped through the cracks,
                   either through inadvertence or unintentional deviation from the selection criteria we have mentioned.
                   To all this must be added, of course, the inevitable potential errors in collation, and, finally,
                   the exclusion of sources, such as rabbinic literature, 
                   which we have not taken into consideration for lack of adequate academic tools.
                   Future collations, to be carried out in the framework of the editorial projects of <abbr>HBCE</abbr> and of <abbr>HUB</abbr>, 
                   and as a part of which the edition of the book of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> is expected to appear, 
                   will allow us to establish the shortcomings and merits of our work.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Finally, we would like to offer some clarifications regarding the digital edition. 
                   As we have said, we have used encoding as a tool to generate the collation and the actual edition. 
                   The digital edition in preparation on <abbr>TEI</abbr>-Publisher will show the same data, 
                   with the possibility of displaying in synoptic mode the Hebrew text of the Leningrad Codex, the critical text, and some of the Versions.
                   What we have not taken into account is the images of the manuscripts.
                   In fact, digital technologies are an ideal tool to deal with image and text alignment, 
                   and indeed digital scholarly editing itself has been forged, one might say, on diplomatic editions,
                   understood as editions that show the image of the witness alongside its transcription (the so-called documentary editions). 
                   We have preferred to focus on the text, 
                   both for reasons related to the sheer quantity of resources and time that text-image alignment would have required,
                   and because the ultimate goal of our work remains a <quote>classical</quote> edition with apparatus, 
                   a genre that still today constitutes a small minority in the digital edition landscape. 
                   The use of the <abbr>TEI</abbr> standard, in any case, 
                   does not preclude the possibility that in the future our edition could also be accompanied by images of at least the most important witnesses,
                   such as the Leningrad Codex and the Qumran fragments.

            <p>
                Degli elementi di originalità del nostro lavoro enucleati alla Sezione <ptr target="#sect-why-a-new-critical-edition"/>,
                quello più importante sul piano del metodo riguarda il fatto che la nostra è un'edizione eclettica, 
                con proposta di testo critico.
                Le edizioni eclettiche, come si sa, costituiscono una netta minoranza nel panorama dell'ecdotica della <abbr>HB</abbr>,
                dominato dal modello diplomatico.
                Senza pretendere di esaurire i termini particolari della diatriba,
                che è antica e trascende la <abbr>HB</abbr>,
                riportiamo qui di seguito alcune delle obiezioni generalmente poste contro la fattibilità delle edizioni eclettiche,
                prendendo le mosse per avanzare schematicamente le nostre osservazioni.
                In ordine crescente di importanza, le obiezioni che riteniamo più significative sono le seguenti:
            </p>
            <p>
                <list type="enumerate">
                    <item>Un testo critico tende a imporsi e a diventare normativo</item>
                    <item>Non abbiamo sufficienti informazioni sulla storia del testo che consentano un'edizione eclettica</item>
                    <item>Il metodo su cui la ricostruzione testuale si basa è altamente soggettivo</item>
                    <item>Il testo ricostruito nelle edizioni eclettiche non è mai esistito</item>                    
                </list>
            </p>
            <p>
                Che un testo critico, cioè eclettico, pubblicato da uno studioso possa imporsi come autoritativo e possa essere adottato,
                ad esempio, come base per successivi studi o traduzioni, 
                è in effetti vero ed è quello che succede normalmente in altre tradizioni letterarie, come i classici.
                Ciò, tuttavia, non deve costuire, in generale, un impedimento all'edizone,
                ma piuttosto un'esortazione a ben lavorare.
                Nel caso specifico della <abbr>HB</abbr>, poi, è difficile immaginare come ciò possa accadere
                considerato il prestigio di cui gode il <term>textus receptus</term>,
                nonché il suo status di testo sacro presso le varie comunità di credenti.
            </p>
            <p>
                La nostra ignoranza della tradizione testuale della <abbr>HB</abbr>, specie nel periodo più antico,
                è stata spesso invocata come argomento contro la fattibilità di un'edizione eclettica, 
                almeno a partire dall'epoca di Kittel.
                Come accennato in § <ptr target="#subsect-an-eclectic-edition"/>,
                l'editore di un'edizione eclettica è costretto ad affrontare tutta una serie di questioni, 
                a cominciare dall'ortografia per finire con i casi di redazioni multiple,
                che un'editore di un'edizione diplomatica può concedersi il lusso di non prendere in considerazione, 
                potendo contare sull'autorità del <term>codex optimus</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                L'accusa di soggettivismo mossa alle edizioni eclettiche, 
                e più in generale al metodo filologico ricostruttivo, è antica, 
                e affonda le radici tanto nella critica del Lachmann ai criteri interni,
                quanto nella nota polemica di Bédier contro l'uso metodo del Lachmann.
                Nell'ecdotica della <abbr>HB</abbr> essa è stata espressa da Tov in questi termini
                <quote>The editors of these [eclectic] editions probably consider them no more than scholarly
                exercises representing the views of a scholar at a given time, 
                with the understanding that the same scholar's view will be quite different by the following year.
                Necessarily, several different eclectic editions of the same biblical book are bound to appear.
                On whose edition, or whose Bible, will scholar focus their exegetical activity?</quote>
                
                chiudere dicendo che anche con un'edizione diplomatica il problema del soggettivismo non può essere eluso
                perchè tutto quello che succede è che ciascun lettore si crea un testo critico nella sua testa
                (Tov Hebrew Scripture Editions, 254)
                
                
                Soggettivismo: Hendel 2013 pg. 87.
                Ogni edizione critica è provvisoria, mai definitiva. Per questo le edizioni critiche vanno fatte sempre.
                POI: il soggettivismo non è un problema, nella misura in cui questo è INTER-SOGGETTIVISMO: 
                cioè bisogna fornire SEMPRE i criteri usati, e per questo c'è l'apparato e soprattutto il commentario testuale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Il testo critico non è mai esistito, perché esso recovers the intention of the author.
                E qui vai di paradigma intenzionalista, così linki con l'originale nella sezione dopo.

            Vari argomenti sono stati avanzati contro le edizioni eclettiche e a favore delle edizioni diplomatiche.

            che è antica e trascende l'ecdotica della HB,
            ne citiamo alcuni...
            Alcuni dicono che la scelta delle lezioni preferite è roba da commentari...
            
            Se c'è una cosa che distingue le edizioni dai commentari è proprio il tentatativo di FORMALIZZARE  i dati e i criteri utilizzati –
            even di renderli computazionalmente machine actionable, se l'edizione è digitale.

            <p>
                As stated at the beginning of this chapter, our philological reconstruction aims at the Original,
                which we define as
                <hi rend="italics">the text of the work, error-free, put into writing, supervised, thought out, and, generally speaking, intended by the Author</hi>. 
                When we feel that the reading of the Original is not attainable, 
                for example due to irremediable corruption, we print the reading of the Archetype,
                <abbr>i.e.</abbr> <hi rend="italics">the text of that exemplar, whether true or ideal, 
                on which the entire textual tradition is supposed to depend</hi>. 
                When not even the reading of the Archetype can be identified,
                as in the very frequent case of readings of equal value, we abstain altogether from making a selection, 
                leaving intact the Masoretic text (§ <ptr target="#subsubsect-indifferent-readings"/>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Put the other way around, we may say that when elements sufficient for us to make a decision do exist, 
                then in that case we identify or reconstruct the reading of the Archetype, 
                <abbr>i.e.</abbr> the reading that best explains the genesis of the other readings; 
                in those instances where we believe this to be erroneous, 
                we correct it by conjecture, and call this corrected text Original.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a historical perspective, therefore, the Archetype constitutes, 
                as <ref target="#Hendel2013">65</ref> writes, <quote resp="#Hendel2013"><hi rend="italics">the latest common ancestor</hi></quote>
                that it is possible to establish on the basis of the available data,
                while the Original represents <quote resp="#Hendel2013"><hi rend="italics">the oldest common ancestor</hi></quote> that can be hypothesised by conjecture. 
                From an operational point of view, the reconstruction of the Archetype thus comes prior to that of the Original: 
                the Archetype represents the first goal of our reconstruction work, while the Original is the ultimate objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we can reconstruct either the Archetype or the Original, however, we must attend to the so-called hyparchetypes. 
                To this end, we reconstruct the text of the Hebrew exemplars that served as models for the ancient translators and copyists.
                These exemplars, named <term>Vorlagen</term>, represent putative ancient copies that are intermediary between the Archetype and the extant witnesses. 
                When different witnesses turn out to share one or more variants due to <term>Vorlage</term>, 
                we assume the existence of a textual family and postulate the existence of a common <term>Vorlage</term>
                responsible for having introduced the variation. 
                We call this common ancestor, according to stemmatic terminology, the hyparchetype
                and posit it at the head of that particular family. 
            </p>            
            <p>
                The statement of intent we have just formulated obviously raises a number of questions,
                starting with that of defining concepts like Original, Author, and Authorial intent – 
                questions that are, in the case of a late book like Qoh, admittedly less tricky
                than in the case of other biblical books, as we shall have occasion to argue.
                We will try to make more precise exactly what we mean by these terms,
                initially discussing the matter in a general sense and then applying it to the particular case of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>.
            </p>            
            <p>
                The information that we are about to detail in the next sections is displayed in the table of relationships at the end of this chapter. 
                This table, it is important to emphasise, is not a <term>stemma codicum</term>:
                its purpose is not to illustrate in detail the process of textual transmission, 
                which would require a much more in-depth discussion of the nature of the variants of the respective hyparchetypes, 
                as well as a calculation of all of the cases of agreements and disagreements among the witnesses; 
                rather, it aims to provide a <quote>big picture</quote> of the textual history of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> and, above all, 
                to assist the reader in understanding the various textual entities involved in the reconstruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the table, the actual witnesses are indicated by a Latin uppercase letters 
                (<quote><abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>,</quote> <quote><abbr>G</abbr>,</quote> <abbr>P</abbr> etc.);
                the hyparchetypes are signalled by lowercase Greek letters 
                (<quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">β</foreign>,</quote> <quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">γ</foreign>,</quote>
                <quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">δ</foreign></quote> etc.); 
                the continuous lines which link the witnesses to the hyparchetypes express descent (that is, vertical transmission),
                whereas dotted lines express contamination (horizontal transmission);
                the Archetype is represented by the Greek letter <quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">α</foreign></quote>,
                while the Original by the Greek letter <quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">Ω</foreign>.</quote>

                <p>
                    In the field of reconstructive philology, 
                    an Archetype is assumed when all the existing witnesses reveal at least one certainly erroneous reading 
                    that cannot be in any way original
                    <note type="foot">
                        See <ref target="#Chiesa2002">80-1</ref>, <ref target="#Roelli2020">223</ref>.
                    </note>.
                    Starting from the obvious presumption that the Author could not have deliberately corrupted his own text, 
                    or from the less obvious one that the Author could not have committed any errors, 
                    the philological method identifies an exemplar distinct from the Original, 
                    namely the Archetype, as <quote>the party responsible</quote> for introducing the error into the various branches of the tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the Original, whose nature often eludes any attempt at definition, 
                    the Archetype is generally conceived of as a <hi rend="italics">real</hi> exemplar, 
                    as a manuscript which <hi rend="italics">historically</hi> existed and of which all the other witnesses constitute a copy. 
                    In some cases, such as in the tradition of the Greek historian Arrian
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Pasquali1988">31f.</ref>
                    </note>, 
                    the Archetype may also be a preserved manuscript, 
                    but more often than not the Archetype has been lost, and it is up to the textual critic to determine its readings through the <term>recensio</term>.
                </p>           
                <p>
                    The Archetype comes to be reconstructed by drawing on readings that are either directly attested in the tradition, 
                    or are at least as close to them as possible in order to explain their genesis.
                    The Archetype, it follows, is situated upstream in the transmission process, 
                    and in a period prior to the date of the oldest surviving witness of that given tradition.
                    Its dating thus depends on external evaluations, of a codicological or palaeographic nature,
                    of the surviving witnesses that are supposed to descend from it.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    In the case of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, an Archetype is undoubtedly conceivable, 
                    if we follow the criteria of the philological method: the book
                    contains passages that are certainly corrupted throughout the tradition 
                    and that can in no way be traced back, in our opinion, to the Original of the work:
                    among the most certain among these we might mention:
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-8-c"/>,
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-3-17-d"/>,
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-3-18-a"/>, and
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-9-b"/>.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    As far as dating is concerned, the oldest witnesses regarding the text of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> are the Qumran manuscripts: the first fragment,
                    <abbr>4QQoh<hi rend="sup">a</hi></abbr>, is palaeographically dated to the mid-II century
                    <abbr>BCE</abbr> (175-150 by Cross)

                    </note>.
                    On the basis of this dating, we can fix the <term>terminus ante quem</term> for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>'s Archetype 
                    in the II century or, perhaps better, the III century <abbr>BCE</abbr>.                    
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Before moving on to discuss the concept of the Original, 
                    we would like to make a few epistemological clarifications on how we see the Archetype. 
                    We are personally inclined <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to conceive of the Archetype as a material entity,
                    as that unique lost manuscript from which the earliest witnesses are said to have been derived by direct copying – 
                    in the same way, let us say, that Lachmann described the Archetype of Lucretius' <hi rend="italics">De Rerum Natura</hi>, 
                    by detailing its physical characteristics 
                    <note type="foot">
                        See <ref target="#Pasquali1988">112-3</ref>,
                        <ref target="#Timpanaro2004">76-8</ref>.
                    </note>. 
                    We take the concept of <quote>Archetype</quote> to be more of an abstraction: 
                    we envision it as a sort of container, into which we deposit those readings that we consider – 
                    using the logic of the copying process  and the rules of textual criticism which underlie it – 
                    to be most likely sources of the historically attested variants. 
                    That the priority of the Archetype over tradition is primarily a <hi rend="italics">logical</hi> priority,
                    established on the basis of the principles of the philological method, does not mean, however,
                    that it cannot also be <hi rend="italics">historical</hi>: 
                    readings considered superior to others on the logical plane are indeed likely to be prior on the temporal plane as well, 
                    and this is the working hypothesis on which the philological method is based.
                    In this sense, the Archetype can be considerd as a <hi rend="italics">historical hypothesis</hi>, 
                    as a restoration of what a hypothetical manuscript, 
                    ancestral to those that populate a textual tradition and beyond which it is impossible for us to explore, might well have looked like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us clarify our position on the Archetype by citing a parallel from historical linguistics, 
                    and particularly from Indo-European linguistics, whose historical-comparative method has much in common, 
                    as Timpanaro has pointed out <note type="foot">See <ref target="#Timpanaro2004">89-110</ref>, especially pp. 89-99.</note>,
                    with the method of reconstructive philology. 
                    The task of historical linguistics is to establish,
                    through the comparison of attested Indo-European languages, a common original form, the Proto-Indo-European. 
                    To this end, it proceeds to identify the common traits among the various daughter languages,
                    relate them to each other, and identify the original form which is most likely to have generated them. 
                    Thus, by relating the Latin <hi rend="italics">pater</hi>,
                    Greek <hi rend="italics">patēr</hi>,
                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italics">pitā</hi>,
                    and Old High German <hi rend="italics">fater</hi>
                    it establishes that the Old High German <hi rend="italics">f</hi> is a secondary development from a Proto-Indo-European <hi rend="italics">*p</hi>, 
                    with the asterisk indicating the reconstructed form, and, proceeding in the same way for each sound of that word, 
                    it will restore to us the Proto-Indo-European <hi rend="italics">*pətēr</hi>. 
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Now, among linguists there is a controversy between <quote>realists</quote> and <quote>formulists</quote>: 
                    the realists conceive of the asterisked forms as genuine historical forms of a real language 
                    and interpret a linguistic reconstruction in terms of a historical process, 
                    with ancestral forms from which the attested forms are actually derived –
                    the example of August Schleicher, author of a fable written in Proto-Indo-European, is perhaps the most famous. 
                    The formulists, by contrast, see the asterisked forms as nothing more than an abstraction, 
                    a scientific notation that serves to establish relations between related linguistic forms, 
                    and interpret the linguistic reconstruction not in terms of time, 
                    but in terms of a simple correspondence between data 
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Fox1995">7-16</ref>, 
                        <ref target="#Villar1997">201-5</ref>.
                    </note>. 
                    In our case, paralleling the same parameters as characterise this controversy, 
                    we might say that, at the level of method, we conceive the archetypal reconstruction in the same manner as the formulists do: 
                    not as the restitution of an actual manuscript, 
                    but as a scholarly artefact which serves to relate attested textual forms in a hierarchical order; 
                    on the level of interpretation, however, 
                    we take the results of the archetypal reconstruction not to be the mere result of the application of abstract logical rules, but, 
                    like the realists, to have a historical, albeit hypothetical, validity.

                    hypothetical manuscripts ancestral to individual witness families. 
                    The logic presiding over the reconstruction of the hyparchetypes is the same as that governing
                    the reconstruction of the Archetype of the tradition as a whole: 
                    it is through the identification of errors common to multiple witnesses
                    that it is possible to hypothesise the existence of a textual family 
                    and thus the descent of these witnesses from a single common ancestor.

                        Its most ancient witnesses is the Hamburg papyrus, dated around the 300 <abbr>CE</abbr> (see § <ptr target="#subsect-data-G"/>).
                        The hyparchetype of <abbr>G</abbr>, therefore, could be dated to the early I century,

                        The literalism of the Greek translator of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, which resembles the style of Aquila, ensures that we can retrovert
                        the readings of this Version with a fair degree of confidence, even down to the smallest particulars.
                        Despite the closeness of this translation to <abbr>M</abbr>, a hyparchetype for proto-<abbr>G</abbr>
                        can be hypothesised: on numerous occasions
                        <abbr>G</abbr> bears variants that are clearly errors due to <term>Vorlage</term> and that characterise all or part of its traditions –
                        and possibly, by contamination, other traditions as well.
                        Such cases are in:

                        The most ancient manuscripts of the Syriac translation, known as Peshitta (<abbr>P</abbr>), are from the V-VI century,
                        but the original translation is theorised as dating several centuries before, usually the II or III century
                        <note type="foot">
                            See <ref target="#Weitzman1999">248-58</ref>.

                        The Syriac translation of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> is on the whole literalistic, 
                        but less word-for-word than Greek.
                        It is generally agreed that it depends on <abbr>M</abbr> and that it draws from <abbr>G</abbr> in case of difficult words and obscure passages
                        <note type="foot">
                            So already <ref target="#Kamenetzky1904">236-7</ref>.
                        </note>.
                        It is, therefore, a product of the hyparchetype of the proto-<abbr>M</abbr> family (see below).
                        A distinct hyparchetype of proto-<abbr>P</abbr>, however, can be hypothesised, thanks to the presence of errors that are likely to
                        derive from a Hebrew <term>Vorlage</term> and that distinguish the <abbr>P</abbr> tradition from all others.
                        Several such instances are:

                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-2-a"/>, and perhaps
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-3-11-c"/>.
                        As we have stated, <abbr>P</abbr> shares many secondary variants with <abbr>G</abbr>,
                        but it is not always clear whether this depends on the influence of <abbr>G</abbr> or rather 
                        on a common <term>Vorlage</term> already affected by contamination (see § <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>).
                        The temporal distance between the first written documentation and the date of the original translation
                        renders difficult the dating of the hyparchetype of <abbr>P</abbr>.  
                        We posit it tentatively in the II century.

                        As with <abbr>P</abbr>, there is a considerable distance between the dating of the original translation and of the earliest witnesses; 
                        the dating of the original translation, however, can be considered certain, 
                        so that a IV century date for the <term>Vorlage</term> on which Jerome worked is likely.
                        Such a <term>Vorlage</term>, however, can hardly function as a separate hyparchetype in a stemmatic sense, 
                        since the errors that characterise these Latin <abbr>Versions</abbr> are in all likelihood translational

                    <p>
                        The same story holds for the Targum, the tradition of which is commonly dated to the VI or VII century

                            See <ref target="#Knobel1991">15</ref>.

                        but whose early manuscripts are much later, from the XII century forward 
                        (see § <ptr target="#subsect-data-T"/> and a more complete list in <ref target="#Clarke1991">84-7</ref>).
                        It is very difficult to extract authentic variants from the corpus of the Targum,
                        given the paraphrastic nature of its translation, but all in all, 
                        despite a few cases of accordance with <abbr>G</abbr> which likely reflects ancient variants,
                        it is clear that <abbr>T</abbr> depends on <abbr>M</abbr>.

                    <p>
                        The translations of <abbr>P</abbr>, Jerome, and <abbr>T</abbr> confirm, therefore, the readings of <abbr>M</abbr>,
                        agreeing with it also in case of errors, such as in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-16-a"/>,
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-8-b"/>,

                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-9-10-a"/>.                 
                        The existence of a hyparchetype for all these translations is therefore plausible.
                        We conventionally term this hyparchetype as proto-<abbr>M</abbr> and date it to around the II century,
                        which is the date  the hyparchetype of the most ancient witness of this group, <abbr>P</abbr>,
                        goes back to, as well as the period in which the revisions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion,
                        which imposed <abbr>M</abbr>-readings onto the ancient Greek translation, were begun.

                        Despite the uniformity of the proto-<abbr>M</abbr> group and the antiquity of its readings,
                        there are several occasions where <abbr>M</abbr> departs from its hyparchetype
                        and isolates itself from all the other witnesses.
                        The assumption of a hyparchetype which introduced the variation 
                        and propagated it to all its descendant members is, therefore, admissible.
                        This occurs, for example, with

                        and with many secondary variants involving pointing.
                        We call this hyparchetype, with <ref target="#Hendel1998">100</ref>, Rabbinic-<abbr>M</abbr>,
                        and date it tentatively  around the time when the Masoretes are said to have begun
                        their activity on the Biblical text, meaning around the VIII century.

                    in practice, of the hyparchetype of <abbr>M</abbr> –

                    The text which we are about to reconstruct has probably <hi rend="italics">never</hi> had a physical existence: 
                    it is a scholarly abstraction and represents our personal perception of the Author's intention;
                    it is the text <hi rend="italics">as (we believe) it should have been</hi>, free not only of errors due to transmission but also  of errors,
                    if any, made by the Author himself. As <ref target="#Segre1979">36</ref> writes:

                    which can be traced back to the intentionalist paradigm adopted by Fox in his edition of Proverbs for the <abbr>HBCE</abbr>

                    obviously involves a strong element of speculation, and therefore requires justification. 
                    To the question   
                    <quote resp="#Bryant2002">how we might characterize this act of getting into <quote>the minds in which works originate,</quote>
                        or, more precisely how do we access past mental events,</quote> 
                    <ref target="#Bryant2002">37</ref>
                    answers in his <hi rend="italics">Fluid Text</hi>
                    that <quote resp="#Bryant2002">the short answer is that we do not, but we think to do. 
                        That is, we only simulate these events and call them editions.</quote>
                    Such simulations are clearly speculative, but they are unavoidable for any reader of texts:
                    as <ref target="#Fox2006">9</ref> maintains, 
                    any reader who comes across a typo will be inclined to correct it and consider the corrected text as the Author's Original. 
                    Such a text <quote resp="#Fox2006">may never have existed precisely in a single manuscript, but it is correct.
                        Nothing other than he intended text is worth the reader's time. 
                        It is only right to do the same for ancient authors.</quote>
                    The same is the case with critical editions:
                    <quote resp="#Tov2012">for those who claim that a certain reading is preferable to another one,</quote>
                    as <ref target="#Tov2012">163</ref> puts it,
                    <quote resp="#Tov2012">are actually presupposing an original text, 
                        since they claim that that reading better reflects the original composition

                    and, we would add, the intent of the Author. 
                    Anyone involved in comparing competing variants or parallel editions of the same text 
                    would inevitably ask questions about the Author's intention, and these questions, <ref target="#Bryant2002">36</ref> observes,
                    <quote resp="#Bryant2002">would necessarily plunge us back again into the writer's mind.</quote>
                    The case of diplomatic editions – but also, in the last analysis, of commentaries or translations –
                    is not so very different: only, in this case, the reader is led, in the absence of variant evaluations by the editor, 
                    to reconstruct virtually his or her own Original, or, if such evaluations are present, 
                    to virtually re-create in his or her mind the Original that the editor has previously, 
                    and just as virtually, reconstructed for him or herself. 
                    The problem of intent and of the <quote>original mind</quote> is, in short, unavoidable, 
                    and a critical edition, no more and no less than any other act of interpretation,
                    is just that: a <quote resp="#Bryant2002">highly educated speculation about intentionality.</quote>
                    <note type="foot"><ref target="#Bryant2002">27</ref>.</note>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though the reconstruction of the Original is speculation, a critical edition is not therefore derived irrationally. 
                    As <ref target="#Bryant2002">114-5</ref> stresses:
                    <quote resp="#Bryant2002">it reflects the editor's <quote>image</quote> of the writer's originating condition,
                        a condition that cannot be known but only speculated upon, or imagined.
                        Without doubt, an editor's speculations are colored by the literary theories and politics that suffuse the editor's culture,
                        despite any announced editorial policy to reduce such subjectivities. [...]
                        A critical edition is a highly complex, presumably well argued <quote>what-if,</quote>
                        a supposing of what might have been. 
                        And this is no more so the case that it is with any history,
                        which is also suppositious and also <hi rend="italics">imaginaire</hi>.</quote> 
                    The comparison between critical edition and history proposed by Bryant is particularly apt,
                    given that textual criticism is <quote resp="#Pasquali1998">essentially, if not solely, a historical discipline</quote>

                        The clear reading text is a crafted rendering of a past moment of intentionality;
                        the editorial notes and apparatus are a narrative of the crafting.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many arguments have been advanced against the existence of an Original for the <abbr>HB</abbr> and therefore against the legitimacy of
                    reconstructing a critical text. 
                    Criticism and scepticism are understandable indeed: few concepts are as slippery as that of the
                    Original, and claiming to want to reconstruct the Original of the Bible may sound unrealistic and unscientific.
                    It is not our intention to reiterate the counter-arguments that have already been so well formulated in favour of such an undertaking by proponents
                    of the eclectic model
                    <note type="foot">

                    nor is it our intention to revisit the age-old issue of the <quote>struggle</quote> between the diplomatic and eclectic models,
                    which  extends well beyond the <abbr>HB</abbr>. 
                    However, we would like to make at least two points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A first consideration concerns the inevitability of judging the originality of variants. 
                    As we have said above, the problem of the Original is inevitable and imposes itself whenever we
                    are faced with two or more competing variants. 
                    The existence of an Original, and also, whether explicitly formulated or not, the concept of
                    the Author's intent, informs not only all of the eclectic editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>
                    <note type="foot">See <ref target="#Borbone1984">271-3</ref> who defines the Original as
                        <quote resp="#Borbone1984">the oldest attested coherent literary unit</quote>, and <ref target="#Borbone1990">21-6</ref>,
                        where the author provides criteria for reconstructing the Original of the book of Hosea; see also 
                        <ref target="#Catastini1995">7-8</ref> for the text of Genesis 37-50

                            that is, the form that the author intended for the text to fulfil a certain function –
                            since it is a fact that this existed; on the possibility or otherwise of achieving it, 
                            there may be a thousand difficulties connected with transmission, 
                            but there is no a priori reason to deny the legitimacy of this attempt</quote>) and
                        <ref target="#Hendel1998">113-4</ref> for Genesis 1-11 
                        (<quote resp="#Hendel1998">The original text, for the purpose of textual criticism, 
                            is a text that once existed and that we attempt to reconstitute by removing the accumulation of scribal errors and changes.</quote>).</note>, 
                    but the diplomatic editions and translations as well. 
                    One may also choose, as the <abbr>HUB</abbr> editors do, not to take a position at all in cases of rival variants, but this does not solve the problem, it simply
                    avoids it by refraining from judgement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second consideration concerns the nature of the critical text itself. 
                    The critical text is neither a transcription of the <term>autograph</term> of the Author nor a stenographic record of his <term>ipsissima verba</term>,
                    which are, needless to say, nonexistent for the <abbr>HB</abbr> as well as for other writings of Antiquity. 
                    The critical text is a scholarly construction, reflecting the editor's personal idea of the Author's original intentions; it is, if we want, 
                    a <hi rend="italics">hypothesis</hi> about the autograph, a <hi rend="italics">guess</hi> about what the putative <term>ipsissima verba</term> might have sounded like.
                    It is, in other words,
                    <hi rend="italics">a stab at the Original</hi>, and it is as close to the Original as we can hope to get by using a critical method. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is this Original which stands at the end of the textual-critical inquiry:
                    in the words of <ref target="#Cross1979">51</ref>,
                    <quote resp="#Cross1979">the supreme goal, or rather the only goal of textual criticism is the reconstruction of the <term>Urtext</term>,
                        however slowly or cautiously we may be required to move forward in its pursuit [emphasis added].</quote>
                    It is our firm conviction that the textual critic has every right not only to undertake his Grail-quest towards the Original,
                    but also to call the result of this quest <quote>Original.</quote> 
                    That such a search is conjectural is obvious, not only because conjecture nourishes any scientific endeavour, 
                    but also because this is how the philological method works: 
                    If the Archetype can be reconstructed on the basis of data deduced from the tradition,
                    and if its existence can be considered to be, if not certain, at least justifiable,
                    then the Original can only be accessed by conjecture, 
                    and its existence can only be hypothesised through correction of the errors found in the Archetype.
                    What the philologist obtains after correcting the errors in the Archetype, 
                    the <quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">Ω</foreign></quote> which stands at the top of a <term>stemma codicum</term>, 
                    <hi rend="italics">is in fact the Original</hi>, or more appropriately formulated, 
                    <hi rend="italics">it is the Original that one arrives at if one adopts the method of philological reconstruction</hi>.                     
                    As <ref target="#Chiesa1992">138-9</ref> has succinctly summarised, 
                    <quote resp="#Chiesa1992">the purpose of textual criticism is to get as close as possible to the original text, 
                        and that by the way of the following steps: 1) <term>Recensio</term> — checking the tradition;
                        2) <term>Examinatio</term> — assessing the originality of the tradition; 
                        and 3) <term>Divinatio</term> — restoring the original text by means of conjecture, or at least establishing the errors.</quote>

                    We can also define the Original as an ideal goal, as a chimerical goal, 
                    as a coveted but unattainable goal of historical-critical enquiry.
                    To the extent that formulations like these are dictated by the desire to emphasise the difficulties that the quest poses, 
                    and thus the provisionality of any critical edition, they cannot, of course, be anything other than subscribed to.
                    But not only, as <ref target="#Catastini1995">8</ref> 8 argues,

                <p>
                    To close our reflection on the Original, 
                    we would like to clarify what we consider to be the difference between the conjectural nature of a critical edition and that of, say, 
                    a study of literary criticism or source criticism,
                    and where the domain of one ends and the other begins. 
                    What, to give an example, is the difference between a conjecture that reestablishes the reading of the Original
                    by restoring the order of letters inverted by metathesis
                    (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">קרבים</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="hb">קברים</foreign> in
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-8-10-a"/>) 
                    and one that reinstates the reading of the Original by eliminating a verse or a stichus on the basis of meter,
                    or by shifting portions of the text to achieve an ideal expository order: 
                    both of these editorial interventions in fact intend to reconstruct the Original 
                    according to the particular editor’s perception of the intent of the Author, 
                    and both do so entirely conjecturally, i.e. without any support in the tradition. 
                    Our belief is that a conjecture proposed in a critical edition should combine maximum possible adherence
                    to tradition and maximum explanatory power: 
                    a scholar who intends to approach the Original with the tools of textual criticism 
                    should not only aim to stick as closely as possible to the facts, i.e. to the tradition, 
                    but also aim at conjectures which, while departing from it as little as possible, 
                    have at the same time maximum explanatory power, i.e., are able to explain the occurrence of all of the readings attested in the tradition –
                    and the assumption of a metathesis in the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> passage mentioned above is a clear example of this, because it is able,
                    through a minimal change in the text, to account for the secondary readings 
                    occurring in the same verse in various witnesses (see commentary there). 
                    Forms of so-called <quote>high criticism,</quote> such as literary and source criticism, 
                    which are less tradition-based and tradition-oriented, can afford higher levels of speculation, and each can hope to arrive,
                    in accordance with its own principles and methods, at its own conception of the Original, 
                    as Ulrich has so well summarised in his list.
                </p>
                <!-- COME SI DATA L'ORIGINALE -->
                <p>
                    Coming to the concrete question of dating the Original, if the Archetype, as we have said,
                    is datable on the basis of evaluations related to the <quote>materiality</quote> of the witnesses of a tradition,
                    then the dating of the Original is in general inferred from internal considerations about the language of the work or the literary genre
                    and, when available, from biographical information about the life of the Author.
                    In the case of biblical books, dating is almost always done internally, by way of analysis of the content of the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> is notoriously poor in elements that would permit a secure dating. 
                    It lacks clear references to historical figures or facts, and those present,
                    such as the identification of the author with King Solomon, are clearly fictional. 
                    Dating is therefore primarily established on a linguistic basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several aspects of the language of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> converge towards a late dating of the work: 
                    the use of syntagmas such as <foreign xml:lang="hb">חוץ מן</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="hb">כאחד</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="hb">כבר</foreign>
                    the presence of Aramaisms (<foreign xml:lang="hb">שלטון</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="hb">שליט</foreign>)
                    and especially Persianisms (<foreign xml:lang="hb">פרדס</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="hb">פתגם</foreign>), 
                    rare or unknown in ancient biblical literature, but frequent in Late Hebrew, 
                    suggest a date not earlier than the Persian period
                    <note type="foot">
                        See the thorough discussion in <ref target="#Weeks2020">57-78</ref>.
                    </note>. 
                    Taking into account the reliable testimony from Qumran, 
                    which allows us to establish a <hi xml:lang="lat">terminus ante quem</hi> for the Archetype of around 200 <abbr>BCE</abbr>, 
                    the Original of the work can be placed in a maximum time period ranging from the V to the III century. 
                    A dating in the late IV century or early III century seems most probable, however, as many authors argue.
                    If the III century is indeed the right century, 
                    we would be faced with the rare case in the <abbr>HB</abbr> where the date of composition and the date of the first written documentation almost coincide. 
                    This fact favours the existence of an Original and an Author in the traditional sense of the term: 
                    as Fox writes, 
                    <quote resp="#Fox2017">Qohelet is one of the few books in the Bible for which it is meaningful to speak of an <term>Urtext</term>,

                <head type="title">The Author</head>
                <p>
                    The definition of Original as the work intended by the Author brings us to the inevitable question of how to define the Author. 
                    In the case of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, it is clear that no one can think of identifying the Author 
                    as the person to whom the books or collections of books are traditionally attributed:
                    Moses for the Pentateuch, Joshua, Samuel, and the Prophets for their respective books, Solomon for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, and so on. 
                    Such books or collections of books are in fact, technically, pseudepigraphs, 
                    and each one has behind it a complex and debated compositional history which sees several authors/redactors in action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the presence of multiple actors responsible for the process of composition/editing,
                    the internationalist paradigm can still be invoked to support the recovery of the author's intent as the goal of a critical edition:
                    as <ref target="#Tanselle1989">75</ref> writes,
                    <quote resp="#Tanselle1989">even though verbal texts [...] become the joint product of several people [...]
                        <hi rend="italics">there is still a single mind that provided the impetus for each work</hi>. [...]
                        neither the social origins of the author's sources and language nor our apparent inability to identify the author's invalidates
                        the search for <hi rend="italics">the mind most responsible for shaping a work</hi>.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the ecdotics of the HB, and especially in the panorama of eclectic editions, 
                    the mind most responsible for shaping a work is usually identified either in the person of the <quote resp="#Borbone1984">redactor,</quote>
                    understood as the figure who <quote resp="#Borbone1984">imprinted a definitive literary structure on the text 
                    and thereby determined in a characteristic and original manner the meaning of passages
                    that might previously have been understood differently</quote> (thus <ref target="#Borbone1984">272</ref> and <ref target="#Borbone1990">22</ref>); 
                    or in the abstract concept of the <quote resp="#Fox2015">collective author,</quote> 
                    understood as <quote resp="#Fox2015">a collectivity that promoted a certain worldview and ideology</quote> (<ref target="#Fox2015">8</ref>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as <abbr>Qoh</abbr> is concerned, the past scholarship of the last two centuries 
                    was inclined to consider the book on a par with other <abbr>HB</abbr> books,
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, as the result of a complex editorial activity involving several authors/redactors. 
                    The anthological character of the composition, consisting of context-free reflections and mottos,
                    apparent contradictory statements and abrupt transitions,
                    was often taken as evidence of a tormented compositional history of original layers, reworkings, and interpolations.
                    Not a few authors have hazarded the exercise of unearthing, with the tools of literary criticism and source criticism,
                    the alleged various editorial layers, even identifying their authorship from time to time.
                    The example of <ref target="#Siegfried1898"/> is perhaps the best known case, as well as one of the most extreme:
                    that scholar identifies an <quote resp="#Siegfried1898">original Qohelet</quote> (Q1, the <quote resp="#Siegfried1898">pessimistischen Philosoph</quote>), 
                    a Sadducee influenced by Epicureanism (Q2, the '<quote resp="#Siegfried1898">epikuräische Glossator</quote>),
                    a sage (Q3, the '<quote resp="#Siegfried1898">Chakham</quote>), 
                    a <quote resp="#Siegfried1898">Chasid</quote> (Q4), several other interpolators (Q5, <quote resp="#Siegfried1898">andere Glossatoren</quote>),
                    two epilogists (E1 and E2) and, finally, two redactors (R1 and R2), 
                    for a total of no less than nine different personalities 
                    <note type="foot">See <ref target="#Siegfried1898">6-12</ref>.</note>.
                    Approaches of this kind have led, as can be imagined, 
                    to atomisations of the text as varied as the scholars who have proposed them and, in some cases, as in <ref target="#Haupt1905"/> and <ref target="#Bickell1884"/>,
                    have even gone so far as to propose an actual rewriting of the book according to a supposedly original expository order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These attempts have mostly been discarded today. 
                    Most recent commentators agree in seeing <abbr>Qoh</abbr> as the work of a single author
                    and tend to explain the alleged inconsistencies as mainly due to the sapiential literary genre 
                    <note type="foot">
                        Arguments – definitive in our opinion – 
                    against the tendencies of past scholarship and in favour of a <quote>unitarist</quote> view have been brought 
                    by Michel Fox in <ref target="#Fox1977"/> and in <ref target="#Fox1989"/>.
                    </note>.

                <p>
                    As far as we are concerned, we consider the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> to be a substantially unitary work:
                    although there is no lack of examples of probable glosses or interpolations already present in the Archetype, 
                    and thus dating from a very early phase of the tradition, 
                    these are not sufficient to postulate a redaction of the work,
                    understood <quote resp="#Borbone1984">as a work that imparts to the text [...] certain characteristics of thought and style.</quote> 
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Borbone1984">272</ref>.
                    </note> The goal we set ourselves of reconstructing the Original, 
                    and of considering such an Original as a single work by a single Author, is thus also justifiable, in the case of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>,
                    on the level of the text's literary history.

            Here, we present the inventory of the documentation we have worked with. 
            We distinguish between direct sources in Hebrew and indirect sources in translation: 
            among the former we include the Masoretic text in Tiberian and Babylonian pointing (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-M"/>)
            and the Qumran manuscripts (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-Q"/>);
            the latter include the Greek version of the Septuagint (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-G"/>),
            the fragments of the Revisors (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-Revisors"/>),  the Syriac version of the Peshitta (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-P"/>),
            the two works of Jerome, the <hi xml:lang="lat">Commentarius in Ecclesiasten</hi>
            and the Vulgate (§ <ptr target="subsect-data-Jer"/>), 
            and finally the Targum (§ <ptr target="#subsect-data-T"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
            For the most part, the readings from these witnesses are taken from their respective critical editions.
            For the following witnesses, however, we have consulted the manuscripts directly, 
            both for an autoptic control and in the absence of critical editions: 
            the Qumran fragments, 
            the Greek Hamburg papyrus, the Syro-Hexapla, 
            the <hi xml:lang="lat">Codex Ambrosianus</hi> of the Peshitta, the Targum, as well as  a number of Hebrew medieval manuscripts.  
            The list of <term>sigla</term> of witnesses which follows is partial 
            and serves to give reader an initial understanding of the data dealt with in the collation: 
            for a detailed list we refer the reader to the critical editions.

                    over previous editions.
                    As for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, the most recent critical edition, that of  <ref target="#Goldman2004"/>,
                    makes use of only two such manuscripts: Firkovich II 34, dated approximately to the X century, 
                    and Additional manuscript 1753 from the Cambridge University Library, a Yemenite manuscript from the XV century

                        See <ref target="#Goldman2004">13-4</ref>,

                <p>
                    The theoretical arguments usually made against the use of the traditional collations are essentially threefold: 
                    the late dating of medieval manuscripts, which would make it unlikely that they preserve ancient variants;
                    the absence of a stemmatic analysis of the kind conducted for the Septuagint manuscripts,
                    which prevents the identification of families and thus the weighing of the value of manuscripts as textual witnesses in critical editions; 
                    and the inaccuracy with which such collations have been compiled, especially by Kennicott. 
                    Without claiming to exhaust the complex issue of the role of medieval manuscripts in HB ecdotics here, 
                    we would like to respond briefly to these arguments,
                    both to clarify our position and to justify the inclusion of data from Kennicott and De Rossi in our work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One objection that can be made to the first argument is methodological and concerns the fact that,
                    as Pasquali has famously shown, late witnesses are not always bearers of late variants (<hi xml:lang="lat">recentiores non deteriores</hi>)
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Pasquali1988">41-108</ref>.
                    </note>.
                    Many of the variants found in the medieval manuscripts of the <abbr>HB</abbr> are known to be found in the ancient <abbr>Versions</abbr> 
                    as well as in the Qumran Scrolls
                    <note type="foot">
                        See <ref target="#Martone2006"/>.
                    </note>.
                    <abbr>Qoh</abbr> seems to be no exception: in a recent study we ourselves conducted on the data offered by De Rossi
                    <note type="foot"> 
                        <ref target="#Bambaci2022"/>.
                    </note>,
                    we found that between 80<hi rend="esc">%</hi> and 90<hi rend="esc">%</hi>
                    of the witnesses he collated share <hi rend="italics">more than half</hi> of the variants with ancient <abbr>Versions</abbr>.
                    If this percentage is not <hi rend="italics">entirely</hi> distorted by De Rossi's collation choices – something we consider to be highly unlikely – 
                    it could well weigh in favour of the possible antiquity, certainly of some, if not of all,  of the variants in the manuscripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as stemmatic analysis is concerned,
                    it is true that few attempts have been made to organise a <term>stemma</term> of the medieval tradition – 
                    and the disregard with which medieval manuscripts are usually treated by most textual scholars
                    has certainly not helped the advancement of studies in this direction.
                    We ourselves have made one such attempt, applying computational techniques of phylogenetic analysis to the Kennicott manuscripts
                    <note type="foot">
                        See <ref target="#Bambaci2021"/> and also 
                        <ref target="#Bambaci2022a"/>.
                    </note>.
                    The result of our study shows that it is in fact possible to group manuscripts into families, 
                    albeit at various levels of confidence: 
                    some of these families are questionable because they are based on variants with weak kinship-revealing power; 
                    others seem more certain, both on the basis of the number of shared variants and on the basis of type.
                    We therefore see no reason to declare, as Goshen-Gottstein does, 
                    that <quote resp="#Goshen-Gottstein1967">any attempt at ordering all medieval witnesses into families according to stemmatic principles
                        is doomed to failure</quote>
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Goshen-Gottstein1967">275</ref>.
                    </note>, let alone to renounce <hi xml:lang="lat">a priori</hi> any such attempts in the future.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The analysis we conducted there, however, is only partial, since we considered only the witnesses of Kennicott,
                    and, among these, only those collated in full. 
                    For this reason we will cite the manuscripts of the collations conventionally, i.e.,
                    individually in our collation (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-medieval-mss"/>) 
                    and counting the total in the apparatus of our edition (§ <ptr target="#subsect-variants"/>). 
                    Against this practice of counting manuscripts instead of weighing their value according to their family affiliation, 
                    as the Lachmannian method (§ <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>) envisages, 
                    one can say all the bad things one wants: 
                    but given the current state of our knowledge of the phylogeny of the medieval <abbr>HB</abbr> tradition,
                    this can be tolerated as a necessary evil.
                </p>
                                
                <p>
                    Even in the absence of a <term>stemma codicum</term>, we believe that manuscripts are important, not only, 
                    as Goshen-Gottstein believes, theoretically, for the study of "<quote resp="#Goshen-Gottstein1967">textual dynamics</quote>" 
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Goshen-Gottstein1967">275</ref>.
                    </note>, or, as Fox puts it, 
                    for their value <quote resp="#Fox2015">to exemplify the <hi rend="italics">kinds</hi> of changes that arose in the course of transmission</quote>
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Fox2015">18</ref>.
                    </note>,
                    but also practically because they provide us with useful material for evaluating variants:
                    if a variant is supported by many codices, Fox rightly sustains, 
                    then it is less likely to be a secondary innovation than one supported by a single manuscript,
                    <quote resp="#Fox2015">since an old reading had more time to penetrate different manuscripts lines.</quote>
                    Manuscript evidence can also be used to prove the opposite case, 
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, to corroborate a suspicion of polygenesis: 
                    if a variant is suspected of being polygenetic,
                    <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, because it is inherently <term>facilior</term> or because it is found scattered in several places in the tradition, 
                    then the fact that it is also found in manuscripts may constitute additional evidence in favour of its exclusion. 
                    It is true that these strategies do not have general validity if they are not substantiated by a <term>stemma</term>,
                    but they do have an empirical one, and there is no reason not to take this evidence into account for the <term>constitutio textus</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the context of our phylogenetic analysis work just mentioned – 
                    and here we respond to the third and final argument – 
                    we personally re-collated some 60 of the codices examined by Kennicott, 
                    in order to verify <quote>in the field</quote> the accusations of unreliability levelled at him.
                    From this recollation it emerged that Kennicott was indeed rather inaccurate in recording variants in his apparatus: 
                    we found that only 86<hi rend="esc">%</hi> of the variants he detected are properly recorded.
                    If we subtract from this percentage those cases in which Kennicott failed to report
                    that the variants were reworked by scribes –
                    in practice, those cases in which Kennicott forgot to affix <term>sigla</term> such as <term>primo</term>, <term>primo</term>, <term>forte</term> – 
                    the accuracy drops to around 46<hi rend="esc">%</hi>. 
                    The check we have carried out on these 60 codices should, however,
                    ensure that many of these inaccuracies or errors have been corrected 
                    and should therefore guarantee greater reliability of the data. 
                    We have not double-checked De Rossi in the same way, 
                    but it is generally agreed that his is a more accurate collation, 
                    with first-hand variant reporting conducted, as De Rossi himself boasted
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#DeRossi1786">xlvii</ref>.
                    </note>, with greater consistency.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also in the context of the above-mentioned work, we also collated six altogether new manuscripts because of their antiquity –
                    limited, however, to the consonantal text only. 
                    The first manuscript is the oldest datable one we have succeeded in finding for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>,
                    but it is fragmentary. 
                    The other five are complete. Here is the list:

                    Manuscripts from the collations are cited according to the catalogue number of the respective collators, 
                    to whom we refer for further bibliographical details. For the printed editions cited by De Rossi,
                    which he does not cite with a catalogue number but with a brief description, 
                    we have devised our own citation system: 
                    after the letter <quote>E</quote> for <quote>edition</quote> and <abbr>R</abbr> for <quote>De Rossi,</quote>
                    we indicate the type of edition (<quote>Mh</quote> for <quote>Machazor</quote>, <quote>Bb</quote> for <quote>entire bible</quote>,
                    <quote>Pt</quote> for <quote>Pentateuch</quote>),  the initial letter of the city and finally the date (the last three digits).
                    When one of these variables is unknown, we append an <quote>x</quote>.
                    Thus, <quote>ERMhP500</quote> means <quote>a printed edition of De Rossi of a Machazor printed in Pisa in the XVI century</quote>;
                    <quote>ERPtX500</quote> means <quote>a printed edition of De Rossi of a Pentateuch of the XVI century, unknown place of publication,</quote>

                        The edition by <ref target="#Field1875"/>, and, occasionally, by <ref target="#Nobil"/>,
                        were consulted as well. 
                        The readings in Syriac were checked against both the edition of the Syro-hexapla by <ref target="#Middeldorpf1835"/>
                        and the manuscript in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana  (see § <ptr target="#subsect-data-G"/>).

        <head type="title">The Method</head>        
        <p>
            An unusually complex form characterises the transmission of the text of the <abbr>HB</abbr>.
            We have direct sources in Hebrew, such as the Qumran Scrolls and the medieval manuscripts,
            and indirect sources in translation, namely, the ancient <abbr>Versions</abbr>.
            With the exception of the Qumran Scrolls, the witnesses in Hebrew are all late, in fact medieval. 
            The witnesses in translation, especially <abbr>G</abbr>, are, by contrast, much older,
            and traditionally constitute, for this reason among others, our main source for reconstructing the original text of the <abbr>HB</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The text-critical prominence of indirect sources over direct ones is one of the peculiarities of the textual tradition of the <abbr>HB</abbr>
            and has obviously important implications for the practice of textual criticism and, ultimately, for the reliability of any philological reconstruction.
            Before evaluating the variants in order to reconstruct the Original, in fact, scholars must extract these variants from the corpus of the Versions,
            reconstructing the text of the Hebrew models used by the ancient translators.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the reconstruction of the Original through the selection of preferred readings (<term>constitutio textus</term>) 
            can be said to obey the very same rules and logic of textual criticism which are valid in other literary domains, 
            it is at the same time evident that the rules and logic involved in the gathering and evaluation of variants (<term>recensio</term>)
            cannot but differ considerably, precisely because of the polyglot nature of the biblical tradition. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This important peculiarity has led us to want to maintain the classic distinction between
            <term>recensio</term> and <term>constitutio textus</term>
            both in the continuation of this chapter, wherein we discuss our method,
            as well as throughout the various sections of this work, where we present the results we have achieved.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Thus, in the discussion that follows, we have made a conscious attempt
            to distinguish, within the <term>recensio</term>, 
            the operation of comparison among textual witnesses which leads to the gathering of the variants
            (the <term>collatio</term>, § <ptr target="#sect-search"/>) 
            from the process of evaluating those variants to establish their originality (<term>examinatio</term>, § <ptr target="#sect-evaluation"/>).
            Within the <term>constitutio textus</term>, by contrast, we have made an effort to differentiate between the operation 
            of choosing the preferred readings from the textual tradition
            (<term>emendatio ope codicum</term>, § <ptr target="#subsubsect-emendatio-ope-codicum"/>)
            from the conjectural reconstruction of the Original (<term>emendatio ope ingenii</term> § <ptr target="#subsubsect-conjectures"/>).
        </p>    
        <p>
            The results of the <term>recensio</term> (Part II) can be found in the collation  (Section 6), 
            where we list the variants of all the traditions we examined, 
            as well as in the critical commentary  (Section 7), where we examine these variants.
            The results of the <term>constitutio</term> (Part III), on the other hand, are to be found in the critical text, 
            where we present our reconstruction of the Original, and in the apparatus, where we justify our choice of readings.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will now illustrate in some detail the method we have followed to achieve the goals outlined in Section <ptr target="#chap-goals"/>, 
            as well as the practices we have adopted to implement the method in the different parts of our work.

            <p>
                Before searching for variants in the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, scholars must first examine their translational techniques, 
                in order to isolate the means which each translator typically adopts to render the Hebrew of his <term>Vorlage</term>,
                and in order to establish the degree of literalness of each Version, that is,
                how faithful to his <term>Vorlage</term> a translator turns out to be.

                Once the character of each <abbr>Version</abbr> has been ascertained, 
                scholars proceed to compare it with the Masoretic text (<abbr>M</abbr>), in search of potential variants underlying the translation.
                This procedure involves a re-translation of such variants into Hebrew as well as a probabilistic assessment
                as to whether such variants actually existed in Hebrew at some point in the history of the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only after Hebrew variants have been established can scholars proceed to weigh them against <abbr>M</abbr>,
                so as to judge which are to be preferred (<hi rend="italics">primary readings</hi>),
                which to be discarded (<hi rend="italics">secondary readings</hi>), 
                and which have equal claims to originality
                (<hi rend="italics">synonymic</hi> or <hi rend="italics">alternative</hi> or <hi rend="italics">indifferent readings</hi>).

            <p>
                In the following sections we illustrate the criteria we have adopted to classify variants 
                according to what we believe to be their probability in reflecting Hebrew variants,
                as well as how we performed the comparison between the <abbr>Versions</abbr> and <abbr>M</abbr> to uncover such variants.

                <p>
                    When comparing the <abbr>Versions</abbr> with <abbr>M</abbr>,
                    scholars need to re-translate versional readings into Hebrew, either mentally, or explicitly in the critical apparatus. 
                    This procedure, termed <term>retroversion</term>, is fully justified when, as McCarter asserts, two criteria are satisfied:
                    the criterion of <hi rend="italics">retrovertibility</hi> and the criterion of <hi rend="italics">authenticity</hi>
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#McCarter1986">63 ff.</ref>
                    </note>.
                    The first concerns the degree of confidence with which we can reconstruct the <term>Vorlagen</term> used by the ancient translators.
                    The second establishes whether a retroversion is authentic, i.e., reflective of a real Hebrew variant.
                    Readings that cannot be retroverted into Hebrew are excluded by the criterion of retrovertibility;
                    readings considered unlikely to have existed in Hebrew <term>Vorlagen</term> are excluded by the criterion of authenticity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before engaging in a critical evaluation of the textual evidence, therefore,
                    <abbr>HB</abbr> textual scholars find themselves faced with three preliminary steps.
                    By using tools such as bilingual concordances and studies on translational techniques in individual biblical books, 
                    they must first verify whether versional readings can soundly be retroverted into Hebrew.
                    Then, they must decide whether these readings are translational (<hi rend="italics">non-variants</hi>), 
                    or reflect genuine Hebrew variants (<hi rend="italics">real variants</hi>, or simply <hi rend="italics">variants</hi>). 
                    Finally, they must evaluate whether these variants really existed in Hebrew <term>Vorlagen</term> deviating from <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                    or were merely generated in the mind of the translators or copyists as the result of a faulty reading of <abbr>M</abbr>
                    (<hi rend="italics">pseudo-variants</hi> or <hi rend="italics">perceptual variants</hi>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only after readings have been retroverted (step one), and it has been ascertained that they are not translational (step two) 
                    and actually circulated in antiquity (step three), 
                    can scholars proceed to decide which of them can legitimately participate, as it were, in reaching the ultimate goal of reconstituting the Original.                    
                </p>

                   <head type="title">Criteria for classification</head>
                   <p>
                       As Tov reminds us, there are no generally accepted demarcation criteria valid for distinguishing among these three types of variants, 
                       let alone for establishing with certainty the authenticity of a given variant.
                       All the readings of the <abbr>Versions</abbr> could, in theory, be translated into Hebrew, and all of them could, again in theory,
                       exist just as much because of a real <term>Vorlage</term> as of a misreading on the part of the ancient translator.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Even so, we believe it possible to establish some strategies which, 
                       even if they obviously do not allow us to affirm that a particular variant existed beyond any reasonable doubt,
                       can at least assist us in formulating working hypotheses on a case-by-case basis.                      
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       We list below six criteria:
                       the first five can be used to distinguish between non-variants and (potential) variants,
                       and the last one to distinguish between variants and pseudo-variants:                       
                       
                       <list type="enumerate">

                               Degree of literalism of the translation. 
                               This criterion establishes that Versions based on more literalistic translation techniques, which aim at a word-for-word correspondence 
                               and at lexical consistency (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>Aq</abbr>), 
                               are more reliable sources of potential variants than <abbr>Versions</abbr>
                               based more on paraphrase-oriented translation techniques (<abbr>Sm</abbr>), 
                               exegesis (<abbr>T</abbr>), or literary rendering (<abbr>V</abbr>).
                               This is a so-called <quote>external</quote> criterion, 
                               one which assigns a preference <hi xml:lang="lat">a priori</hi> to certain witnesses rather than to others. 
                               As we will discuss below, we availed ourselves of this as our operational criterion in the production of the collation
                               (see § <ptr target="#subsubsect-criteria-collation"/>).

                                   Level of difficulty of the translation. 
                                   A versional reading is more likely to derive from a Hebrew <term>Vorlage</term> 
                                   if it yields a difficult or patently erroneous text. 
                                   An example is  <abbr>G</abbr> in
                                   <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-9-b"/>,
                                   <ptr type="app" target="#app-6-4-a"/>, and

                                   Conversely, translations that return a simpler, more flowing text are more likely to be translational (non-variant).

                               External backing of Hebrew witnesses.
                               Retroversion of a versional reading is more likely if the corresponding Hebrew variant is found attested in Hebrew witnesses,
                               such as medieval manuscripts.
                               A versional reading can obviously have arisen independently of <term>Vorlage</term>,
                               for example, by way of a textual interpretation similar to that reflected by the Hebrew witnesses: 
                               It can, in other words, be polygenetic. 
                               Nevertheless, the polygenetic character can itself be invoked as an argument
                               in favor of the existence of the variant at different moments in the history of the text.

                               Convergence of stemmatically distant traditions.
                               Retroversion of a versional reading is more likely if that reading is supported by traditions that rarely share variants. 
                               An example is the instances of agreement between <abbr>Aq</abbr> and <abbr>P</abbr>
                               or, more numerous, between <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>T</abbr>.

                               Common <term>Vorlage</term> as  the most parsimonious explanation.
                               Even without the support of the preceding four criteria,
                               sometimes a common <term>Vorlage</term> stands out, as it were, 
                               when multiple witnesses seem to converge towards the same Hebrew text. 
                               In cases like this, a common <term>Vorlage</term> is the most parsimonious explanation, 
                               in the sense that it is the one that requires the fewest mutations to account for the distribution of the witnesses within the textual tradition:
                               in fact, it is simpler to assume that all the witnesses read once from the same Hebrew text, 
                               rather than that they all arrived at the same understanding independently. 
                               This general principle of economy
                               (on which see our remarks in  § <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>),
                               should be applied, however, with caution,
                               because it is by no means obvious that a common reading always points to a common Hebrew model:
                               a quintessential example is the Hebrew <quote>misgrammars</quote>
                               (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> disagreements in number between subject and verbs), 
                               which translators tend to repair in their translations.
                           </item>
                           <item>
                               Translation  deriving  from a paleographic or aural error.
                               If the cause of the variant is an exchange of palaeographically or phonetically similar letters, 
                               then the probability that this variant <quote>happened</quote> in the mind of the translator/copyist is higher
                               than in the case of more complex variants, 
                               the genesis of which requires the existence of a written support.
                           </item>

                   <p>
                       The distinction between the various kinds of variants can of necessity only be subjective and, in the last analysis, 
                       can only derive from the manner in which the particular scholar conceives the textual history of each variant. 
                       Indeed, in the words of <ref target="#Goshen-Gottstein1963">132</ref>,
                       <quote resp="#Gottstein1963">there is no retroversion without a residue of doubt, and what seems self-evident to one scholar
                           may look like a house of cards to his fellow.</quote>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       In positing the above mentioned criteria, therefore, we clearly do not aim to establish a set of general rules,
                       but rather to render our evaluations as inter-subjective as possible, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, more transparent and explicit for the reader.
                       In our collation, we attempt to classify retroversions according to these six criteria, 
                       with each retroversion being followed by the number of the corresponding criterion
                       (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <quote><hi rend="esc">{</hi><hi rend="italics">crit</hi>: 1, 2 etc.<hi rend="esc">}</hi></quote>),
                       and in the commentary which accompanies the collation, 
                       we discuss case by case the various proposals for retroversion, 
                       specifying for each the criteria which we believe justify our reconstructions.
                       
                       <!--[INSISTERE QUI: dire che essere inter-soggettivi è tutto quello che si può fare, visto che tutto è incerto].-->
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Always keeping firmly in mind our goal of intersubjectivity,
                       we have also wanted to establish a sort of  personal <quote>table of values</quote> 
                       expressing our perception of the probability as to whether a versional reading can soundly be retroverted into Hebrew and considered authentic or not.
                       We have followed this grid in classifying all the variants gathered into our collation 
                       as well as in the apparatus of our edition. 
                       Each degree of retroversional probability is signalled by a special typographical convention, as follows:

                                   Null: when a reading cannot be retroverted or its retroversion is considered highly unlikely (<hi rend="italics">non-variant</hi>).
                                   Readings of this category are considered either translational or inner-corruption phenomena 
                                   and are consequently not assigned any retroversion.
                               </p>

                                   which is considered as an inner-corruption for the Greek

                                   Low: when a reading can in principle be retroverted, but its existence either as a real or virtual variant is highly unlikely. 
                                   Readings of this category are considered to be inner-translational phenomena and their retroversions,
                                   marked by a double question mark placed in superscript before and after,
                                   are suggested only as reminders, to show how the readings might look if their <term>Vorlage</term> were in Hebrew.

                                   An example is the rendering of <abbr>M</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">שואף</foreign> <quote>aspire</quote>
                                   with verbs meaning <quote>to return</quote> by <abbr>Sm</abbr>-<abbr>Th</abbr>,  <abbr>P</abbr>, and <abbr>V</abbr> in

                                   Judging such a reading highly improbable, we mark it accordingly as

                                   Unknown: when a reading can be retroverted, but its existence, whether real or virtual, is questionable. 
                                   Retroversions of this category are marked by a single question mark placed in superscript before the retroversion.

                                   Many retroversions we conjectured for <abbr>Qoh</abbr> belong to this category: 
                                   many retroversions are indeed plausible, but lack conclusive supporting evidence. 
                                   An example is <quote>king of Jerusalem</quote> read by <abbr>P</abbr> and Jerome in

                                   and it is as likely to have existed in writing as to have arisen from miscopying or from intentional correction (<hi rend="italics">pseudo-variant</hi>). 
                                   Readings of this category are signalled by angle brackets.

                                   As stated above before, variants deriving from graphic or phonetic changes can be assigned to this category:

                               Retroversions belonging to this category are shown without any typographical sign,
                               <abbr>e.g.</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך ישראל בירושלים</foreign> reflected by <abbr>G</abbr> in 
                               <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-1-a"/>, which is considered rather secure due of the literalism of the Greek translator.

                    Since, as noted, the greater part of the versional readings may in fact receive a retroversion,
                    scholars need to decide what attitude to adopt by default, as it were,
                    when dealing with the ancient Versions, before proceeding to record the variants.

                    In the field of textual criticism of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, the traditional approach is what Weitzman called
                    <hi rend="italics">the maximalist approach</hi>, which implies that,
                    whenever discrepancies between <abbr>M</abbr> and the <abbr>Versions</abbr> are encountered, 
                    the editors should first consider them all as translational, 
                    <quote resp="#Weitzman1999">and only after all possible translational explanations have been dismissed</quote> should they
                    <quote resp="#Weitzman1999">address the assumption that the translation represents a Hebrew reading different from the M[asoretic] T[ext]</quote>

                    In case of uncertainty, when it is impossible to ensure with a fair degree of confidence that a given retroverted variant points to a real <term>Vorlage</term>,
                    it is usually recommended, as McCarter puts it, that
                    <quote resp="McCarter1986">the reading in question must be excluded from consideration, 
                    even if the critic suspects it contains the primitive text</quote>

                <p>
                    The critical apparatus of an edition that follows the maximalist approach will have a low <hi rend="italics">degree of collation</hi>,
                    meaning that the variants recorded therein will be the result of a selection of all the possible textual differences among the collated witnesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The opposite approach is the <hi rend="italics">minimalist approach</hi>, which ascribes the textual differences to different Hebrew <term>Vorlagen</term>
                    every time a Hebrew reading seems to be reasonably derivable from a translation, that is, every time the criterion of retrovertibility is fulfilled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The apparatus of an edition that adheres to this approach will have a high degree of collation, 
                    with a high number of recorded variants and possibly of corresponding retroversions.
                    Among the existing editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, 
                    the <abbr>HUB</abbr> can certainly be said to follow a minimalist approach towards primary sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An edition based on a minimalist approach will be able to claim exhaustiveness,
                    insofar as it succeeds in providing the reader with a broad compilation of all or most instances of suspected textual variation.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The advantages of an exhaustive collation of the variants are substantial, as can be imagined, 
                    and not only for the reader, but also for the researcher: 
                    the reader will have before him a complete collection
                    which will save him from having to personally consult the ancient sources or to resort to the comparison of several critical editions;
                    the researcher will have at his disposal a complete critical apparatus which,
                    as Varvaro notes
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Varvaro2012">97</ref>.
                    </note>, will allow for the easy insertion of new uncollated witnesses, should they emerge, 
                    and for the immediate identification of the shared variants; a complete critical apparatus,
                    it follows, will lend itself well to being used as a source for studies of various kinds, 
                    not only of textual criticism, but also of the history of tradition or linguistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This ambition for exhaustiveness, however, is problematic, 
                    because it risks overwhelming the critical apparatus with an assemblage of variants that are, at best, unimportant, and, at worst, not variants at all. 
                    The more indiscriminate the choice of variants to be cited in the apparatus and the more varied their nature, 
                    the greater the likelihood that such an edition will veer away from being <quote>critical,</quote>
                    if by critical we mean the operation of selecting only those variants which are meaningful for the text and its history
                    <note type="foot">
                        A criticism of this sort can be levelled at the <abbr>HUB</abbr> edition.
                        In the words of <ref target="#Hendel2013">98</ref>:
                        <quote resp="#Hendel2013">[t]he <abbr>HUB</abbr> is a [...] labyrinth of real and pseudo-variants [...] by failing to distinguish consistently
                        between real and apparent variants (it does intermittently) the <abbr>HUB</abbr> falls short of its aim of presenting facts.
                        It presents the simulacrum of textual acts, some of which are translational phenomena, and others insignificant medieval spelling

                <p>
                    Conversely, an edition based on a maximalist approach will provide the reader with a reasoned selection of those instances of variation judged to be most significant, 
                    with a critical apparatus easier to consult and of smaller dimensions –
                    this last a feature also dictated by unavoidable external factors, such as the space limitations conceded by the various editorial projects.
                    Such a choice, however, is always based on a pre-selection, the criteria for which are not only necessarily subjective,
                    but often either go unmentioned or are too vague to be of any help to the reader, 
                    who will obviously, as a result, be compelled to guess at them <hi xml:lang="lat">e silentio</hi>
                    <note type="foot">
                        An example comes from the selection criteria outlined by the editors of the <abbr>BHQ</abbr>.
                        In the <hi rend="italics">General Introduction</hi>, they state that the critical apparatus presents
                        <quote resp="#Schenker2004">only a selection of textual cases, emphasizing those that are of substance for translation and exegesis,</quote>
                        and that the variants registered therein are those that are 
                        (1) <quote resp="#Schenker2004">text-critically significant</quote> 
                        and (2) <quote resp="#Schenker2004">judged to be significant for translation or exegesis</quote> (see <ref target="#Schenker2004">xiii</ref>).
                        Both these criteria have been rightly criticised by <ref target="#Tov2008">192</ref>,
                        the first as <quote resp="#Tov2008">self-evident</quote> and not always clearly applied in practice, 
                        the second as too general, <quote resp="#Tov2008">since almost any variation is of interest at some exegetical level.</quote>
                        A similar criticism comes from <ref target="#Hendel2008">337, note 42</ref>, who points out that <quote>it is not entirely clear what textual
                        evidence this criterion includes and excludes.</quote>
                    </note>.
                </p>     
                <p>
                    Thus, for instance, if a variant is missing in the critical apparatus,
                    it is not always clear whether the reason is that the editor considered it as translational (non-variant), 
                    or text-critically irrelevant (secondary variant), or simply failed to recognize it from among the <abbr>Versions</abbr> or forgot to mention it in the apparatus. 
                    This influences not only the reader's perception of the text –
                    if a variant is missing, the reader's inevitable impression is that the text has been transmitted faithfully at that particular point – 
                    but also her or his ability to retrace the process that led the editor to select certain readings and to exclude others, 
                    and possibly to disagree with his or her judgement – 
                    a disagreement, needless to say, that the reader is not in a position to articulate 
                    without having to compare on his own several critical editions of the same text,
                    or after needing once again to collate the ancient sources, as in our case here.

                    A maximalist edition, in short, is not only less informative than a minimalist one, 
                    but ultimately less scientific, if by <quote>scientific</quote> we mean, with Popper,
                    the possibility for a scientific statement <quote>to be inter-subjectively tested,</quote>
                    that is, to be understood and tested by anyone on the basis of shared criteria of evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As can be inferred from this description, we believe 
                    that the shortcomings of a maximalist edition are, on an epistemological level, more serious than those characterising a minimalist edition. 
                    At the same time, however, we are aware that an editor, in the apparatus of his edition,
                    <hi rend="italics">is compelled</hi> to choose among the variants, and that it is precisely this obligation
                    that distinguishes a critical edition from a collation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To summarize our thinking, we believe that a minimalist edition 
                    that aspires to the exhaustiveness of a collation will be difficult to define as a <quote>critical edition,</quote> 
                    and that a maximalist edition that  lacks clear and concise criteria for the selection of variants 
                    will fail to meet those requirements of inter-subjective control that render it, in fact, scientific.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In light of these assessments, we have opted for a compromise solution that seeks to marry the strengths of both types of editions:
                    that is, we have opted for  <hi rend="italics">minimalist edition with collation,</hi> following the example of several notable studies
                    <note xml:id="notaCatastini" type="foot">
                        We are referring in particular to the work conducted by A. Catastini on the text of Genesis 37-50, 
                        which consists of a systematic <term>recensio</term> of the tradition (<ref target="#Catastini1995"/>)
                        and a proper critical edition, with an array of significant variants, translation, and commentary on the text (<ref target="#Catastini1995"/>).
                    </note>.
                    This decision, in keeping with the operational distinction between <term>recensio</term> and <term>constitutio</term>
                    outlined at the beginning of the chapter, has allowed us, on the one hand, to maintain a minimalist approach towards the translational techniques, 
                    and thus, to strive for exhaustiveness – within the limits, obviously, of the sources consulted 
                    as well as of the collation criteria that we have set ourselves. 
                    On the other hand, this decision has allowed us to make the process of selecting variants shown in the critical apparatus more easily traceable and hence, 
                    we believe, more transparent.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Thus, in our collation we have assembled <hi rend="italics">all</hi> of the variants or potential variants  that we have managed to gather,
                    applying the criteria we will discuss shortly (§ <ptr target="#subsubsect-criteria-collation"/>).
                    In the critical apparatus of the edition, we report a selection of these variants, presenting only those that we have judged to be real,
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr> responding to classification criteria 3, 4, and 5 outlined in § <ptr target="#subsubsect-criteria-retroversions"/>.              
                    In this way we have been able to narrow the dimensions of the apparatus, freeing it from all non-variants: 
                    while a few non-variants may indeed be important for the exegesis and study of individual witnesses,
                    it is our opinion that they should not appear in the apparatus of a critical edition, 
                    which should ultimately deal only with those variants which are <hi rend="italics">textual</hi> or deemed to be so.

                        For the purposes of collation, we have divided the textual witnesses into two groups and two respective subgroups,
                        to each of which we assign a different priority for purposes of identifying variants.

                        A first subdivision mirrors that of the original <hi rend="italics">language of composition</hi>. 
                        We therefore distinguish between the Qumran fragments and medieval manuscripts on the one hand (direct sources), 
                        and the <abbr>Versions</abbr> on the other (indirect sources). 
                        This distinction, as we said at the beginning of the chapter, emerges naturally, 
                        since the collation must of necessity be performed differently in the two cases.

                        A second subdivision is made on the basis of <hi rend="italics">date</hi>, in the case of direct sources,
                        and on the basis of <hi rend="italics">translation techniques</hi>, in the case of indirect ones. 
                        On one side, therefore, we group the manuscripts of Qumran, which represent the oldest evidence in Hebrew that we have at our disposal, 
                        as well as the <abbr>Versions</abbr> of <abbr>G</abbr>, <abbr>Aq</abbr>, <abbr>P</abbr>, and <abbr>Hi</abbr>,
                        which are characterised by a greater degree of literalism with respect to the Hebrew text.
                        On the other side, we place the medieval manuscripts, which are the latest witnesses of the Hebrew text of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>,
                        and  <abbr>Sm</abbr>, <abbr>Th</abbr>, <abbr>V</abbr>, and <abbr>T</abbr>, 
                        which are the least literalistic among the <abbr>Versions</abbr>. 
                        We assign a higher priority to the first category, and a lower one to the second, as we are about to explain.
                    </p>
                    <!-- FONTI INDIRETTE -->
                    <p>
                        As far as the Versions are concerned,
                        we follow <hi rend="italics">a minimalist approach towards the translational techniques of the first group of Versions</hi>, 
                        meaning that we systematically compare each of these <abbr>Versions</abbr> with the Hebrew reference text (<abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>), 
                        and consider a reading as a variant – and as a consequence, we open an apparatus entry – 
                        <hi rend="italics">whenever we deem it possible to retrovert into Hebrew at least one variant of at least one of these <abbr>Versions</abbr></hi>.
                        The ratio we follow, therefore, is one to one: <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>G</abbr>, 
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>Aq</abbr>, 
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>P</abbr>, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We search for variants using mainly the critical text established in the respective critical editions, 
                        but the <term>varia lectio</term> contained in the apparatus of those editions is taken into account as well,
                        especially in the case of <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>P</abbr>.
                    </p>                                        
                    <p>
                        As to <abbr>Versions</abbr> of the second group, we do not use them as independent terms of comparison, 
                        as their translational techniques are too unliteralistic and offer therefore too uncertain a basis for textual reconstruction.  
                        With this group of <abbr>Versions</abbr>, we follow a ratio of one to (at least) two,
                        which means that we open an apparatus entry whenever <hi rend="italics">at least two of these <abbr>Versions</abbr>,
                            or one of these <abbr>Versions</abbr> and the medieval manuscripts, are found to share a possible Hebrew variant,</hi>
                        thus:
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>Sm</abbr>-<abbr>Th</abbr>,
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>Sm</abbr>-<abbr>V</abbr>,
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> <abbr>Sm</abbr>-<abbr>M<hi rend="sup">Mss</hi></abbr> etc.
                        This is not done systematically, however, for in many cases we deem the variants to be only apparent,
                        despite their being easily retrovertable into Hebrew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a rule, therefore, the reader will not find, either in the collation or in the critical apparatus of the edition, 
                        cases of <hi rend="italics">binary opposition</hi> between these witnesses, 
                        i.e.,  cases in which a reading of <abbr>Sm</abbr>, or of <abbr>Th</abbr>, or of <abbr>V</abbr> etc. 
                        opposes all the other witnesses together, because these would be innumerable: 
                        one need only think of the systematic stylistic omissions in <abbr>V</abbr> or the numerous midrashic additions in <abbr>T</abbr>.
                        (A few exceptions have been made where some of these variants have gained the attention
                        of some commentator or other and are therefore found cited and discussed in the secondary literature.)
                    </p>                    
                    <!-- FONTI DIRETTE -->
                    <p>
                        Turning to direct sources, we have of course assigned top priority to the Qumran manuscripts. 
                        Our juxtaposition of these with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> is systematic: 
                        we have sought to take into account all of the detectable textual differences from <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>,
                        including dubious readings and graphic variants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As to medieval manuscripts, we have accorded to them the same treatment as we have to the non-literal Versions, i.e.,
                        we cite their variants only <hi rend="italics">when they have the direct support of at least one of the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, 
                            or when the comparison between the variants of the manuscripts and the <abbr>Versions</abbr> proves useful for general text-critical discussion</hi>. 
                        This means that the reader will find the codices cited only when they agree in a variant reading with the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, or when
                        they disagree and the disagreement is considered significant (see, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, the testimony of manuscript K76 in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-1-a"/>),
                        while he will not find places of variation where the codices stand in opposition to all the other witnesses together (binary opposition).
                    </p>              
                    <p>
                        For both groups of witnesses, we have naturally taken the secondary literature into account – 
                        the other editions of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, as well as textual commentaries and articles – 
                        where many of the variants we present have been identified and discussed
                        (see § <ptr target="#subsect-second-apparatus"/> for a list of those studies <quote>collated</quote> in detail for the search for variants).
                    </p>      
                    <p>
                        In the case of both the <abbr>Versions</abbr> and the medieval witnesses, 
                        we have not taken into account phenomena judged to be internal to single traditions. 
                        As regards the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, we do cite, by way of example,
                        the numerous graphic variants such as those due to an exchange of similar letters or to itacism in Greek,
                        and variants due to mechanical issues such as homeoteleuton, dittography, etc., which are not attributable to Hebrew <term>Vorlagen</term>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of the medieval tradition, we have excluded those variants concerning <term>matres lectionis</term> and pointing, 
                        unless they affect the meaning (see § <ptr target="#sect-emendatio"/>). 
                        <note type="side">Examples here</note>
                        Judging by the presence of several of these variants in modern editions of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, this omission could be considered important.
                        However, we consider these variants not to be pertinent to our edition, 
                        which aims to reconstruct a text dated to the ancient period, significantly antedating medieval transmission.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        In summary, we have based our collation on:
                        <list type="enumerate">
                            <item>variants from Qumran and from the more literalistic <abbr>Versions</abbr>, including those in binary opposition</item>
                            <item>variants from the less literalistic <abbr>Versions</abbr>, excluding those in binary opposition</item>
                        </list>
                        
                        The following are excluded:                        
                        <list type="enumerate">
                            <item>Variants from the less literalistic <abbr>Versions</abbr> and from medieval codices when in binary opposition;</item>
                            <item>graphic variants from medieval manuscripts;</item>
                            <item>variants internal to individual traditions, including the Masoretic.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>              
                        Before moving on to illustrate the criteria for evaluating variants, 
                        we feel that a few observations are in place regarding the criteria for selecting the variants set out here and in the previous section.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Despite our prior discussion regarding exhaustiveness and inter-subjectivity, 
                        we do not claim that the cases of textual variation that we have collected represent all the cases of variation possible for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, 
                        nor can we exclude the possibility that we might in some way have derogated from the collation criteria that we have just imposed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, not every possible source for the history of the <abbr>Qoh</abbr> text has been examined: the rabbinic tradition, just to name one.
                        Second, as we have pointed out, some potential variants, 
                        such as those contained in the critical apparatus of the respective editions of the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, 
                        were not taken into account <hi xml:lang="lat">a priori</hi>, while others may have escaped our attention inadvertently. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A certain degree of tacit pre-selection, so to speak, and therefore of eclecticism, is present and perhaps even inevitable, 
                        given the nature of the <abbr>HB</abbr> tradition, in the same way as collation errors and involuntary omissions. 
                        All in all, however, we believe that the variants we have collected constitute the great majority of those that can be hypothesised for <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, 
                        or in any event – and also in light of a comparison with the secondary literature – represent those of the greatest importance
                        and those which are therefore in a position to give our study a commensurate value.

            <p>
                Once the variants have been identified and collected, 
                we move on to evaluate which of them are most likely to reflect the original reading and which, instead, 
                are secondary developments produced by corruption. This operation is called the <term>examinatio</term>.
            </p>            
            <p>
                The <term>examinatio</term> is carried out through two classes of criteria, known in scientific literature as
                <term>external criteria</term> and <term>internal criteria</term>.
                Generally speaking, external criteria establish the superiority of one reading over another on the basis of extrinsic factors, 
                such as the age, the quantity, the quality, or the stemmatic weight of the witness that carries it.
                Internal criteria take into account the intrinsic value of each reading, which is analysed 
                on the basis, for example, of its meaning and pertinence within the general context, or of its linguistic and literary merit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There follows an explanation of both sets of criteria, as we have applied them.
                We offer a brief typological description for each criterion 
                as well as a few examples of its application, as taken from the edition.
                Each criterion is marked by a Latin letter (in lowercase for internal criteria and uppercase for external) and bounded by curly brackets. 
                This form of annotation is used in the critical apparatus of the edition to express our evaluation of the variant readings (see § <ptr target="#sect-crit-app"/>).
                Finally, we append a list of the most significant phenomena of variation that we have found in <abbr>Qoh</abbr> 
                and which characterise those readings that we judge to be secondary. 
                These characterisations, placed in round parentheses, 
                are also used in the apparatus to communicate our evaluation of the variants.

            <div type="subsection" xml:id="subsect-external-crit">
                <head type="title">External criteria</head>   
                <p>
                    Within the most widespread method of reconstructive philology, the genealogical or Lachmannian method,
                    the most important evaluation criteria are the external stemmatic criteria, 
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, those that find their foundation and justification in the <term>stemma codicum</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <term>stemma codicum</term> performs two fundamental functions: 
                    to represent the history of the textual transmission extending from the Archetype to current witnesses
                    (<term>historia textus</term>), and to assist the editor in selecting readings (<term>constitutio textus</term>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reconstruction of the textual history encompasses the identification of relations of <hi rend="italics">genealogical descent</hi>,
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, those cases in which one or more textual witnesses are shown to descend from a common ancestor or hyparchetype.
                    The genealogical investigation, known as <term>constitutio stemmatis</term>, 
                    proceeds to group all of the witnesses into families under their respective hyparchetypes, 
                    all the way up to the identification of the ancestor common to the entire tradition, namely, the Archetype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The identification of the lineage relationships of this sort is crucial in being able to choose the original readings:
                    it is clear, in fact, that if a manuscript is proven to be descended from another by direct copy (<term>codex descriptus</term>),
                    its weight as a textual witness will be null and the critic will be led to exclude it in the evaluation of the variants (<term>eliminatio descriptorum</term>).
                    Witnesses that appear, on the other hand, to be independent will have greater weight and their readings,
                    especially if supported by the conformance of distinct branches of the tradition, will be assigned a greater preference.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Through the definition of the <term>stemma</term>, the genealogical method aims to make practically automatic the choice among competing readings,
                    assigning priority to that reading which is found to be attested by the majority of branches in the tradition. 
                    Indeed, while it is a matter of a majority principle, it is one based on a <quote>weighted</quote> majority, so to speak:
                    it is not the absolute total of witnesses in support of a certain variant that really matters,
                    but the totality of the independent witnesses found in the <term>upper reaches</term> of the <term>stemma</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event that it is not possible to assemble a majority of witnesses in this way – 
                    for example, when the tradition is bipartite, i.e., in two branches – 
                    the editor will resort to internal criteria.  
                    When even this turns out to be impossible, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>,  in the case of an even-weightedness among variants, 
                    the editor may choose to rely upon the reading within that branch of the tradition which has most often proven
                    to be carry the greater number of valid variants, 
                    or he may also turn to other external non-stemmatic criteria, such as the criterion of the best or most ancient manuscript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The choice, known as <term>selectio</term>, between readings that are equivalent, whether stemmatically 
                    or intrinsically (<term>indifferent readings</term>), constitutes, however, an <hi xml:lang="lat">extrema ratio</hi> within the Lachmannian paradigm,
                    the goal of which is in fact to reduce to a minimum the need to resort to the <term>selectio</term>, 
                    that is, to the discretion (<term>judicium</term>) of the particular editor.

                    The Lachmannian methodology just described is difficult to apply to the <abbr>HB</abbr>, for a number of reasons.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The first has to do with the individuation of the so-called conjunctive errors, 
                    which are indispensable for the construction of the <term>stemma</term>. 
                    The requisites which such errors must meet are particularly selective,
                    since such errors must be monogenetic, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, they cannot arise in multiple witnesses independently (criterion of irreproducibility), 
                    and they must also be irreversible, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> such as not to be so obvious as to attract
                    the attention of copyists and therefore be corrected by conjecture (criterion of irreversibility).

                <p>
                    A second reason involves the well-known phenomenon of horizontal transmission or contamination, 
                    which is very frequent in the case of widely read and copied texts, such as the <abbr>HB</abbr>. 
                    In the presence of contamination, the division into the various families will end up being more fluid and
                    the majority criterion will not always be able to be applied. 
                    Even were it possible to identify monogenetic errors and to construct the <term>stemma</term> despite contamination, 
                    this could, at most, have value as a general historical scheme, 
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, it could fulfil its function of displaying the <term>historia textus</term>,
                    but it would be useless for the purposes of the <term>constitutio</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of a biblical book, moreover, it is very probable that the <term>constitutio stemmatis</term> 
                    would lead to a bipartite <term>stemma</term>
                    <note type="foot">
                        Bipartite, for example, are the <term>stemma</term> proposed by <ref target="#Hendel1998">100</ref> for Genesis 1-11

                    so that the editor will find himself, in any event, being compelled to make a choice by way of <term>selectio</term>
                    between the two principal and well-known branches of the tradition –
                    the Masoretic <quote>family</quote> (<abbr>M</abbr>, <abbr>P</abbr>, Jerome) 
                    on one side and <abbr>G</abbr> on the other – 
                    and to disentangle the various and equally well-known phenomena of contamination –
                    <abbr>P</abbr> and Jerome with <abbr>G</abbr>; <abbr>V</abbr> with <abbr>Sm</abbr>;
                    and, of course, the Revisors with <abbr>M</abbr>. 
                    A <term>stemma</term> of a book of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, in short, will not only act with great difficulty as a decision-making tool, 
                    but it will tell us things about the history of the tradition which, when all is said and done, we already know.

                <p>
                    We believe that the book of <abbr>Qoh</abbr> well illustrates the problems just outlined: 
                    it is impossible, in our opinion, to trace conjunctive errors,
                    and those that <hi rend="italics">seem</hi> sufficiently kinship-revealing to be possible candidates for such a role
                    (for example,
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-10-a"/>,
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-5-a"/>,

                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-8-8-c"/>, and
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-12-9-b"/>) 
                    would merely recreate for us a time-worn bipartite tradition, with a constellation of witnesses already long-established.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the face of a situation of this kind, it should not surprise us that internal criteria  constitute, still today, 
                    the most widely used evaluation tool in the field of Old Testament philology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, that Lachmann's method is hardly applicable and that the construction of a <term>stemma</term>
                    is fundamentally useless for purposes of the <term>constitutio</term>, 
                    obviously do not mean that the genealogical principles underlying it are either inapplicable or useless,
                    nor that one cannot extract from external criteria a system of heuristics useful also for the edition of an ancient biblical text.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Despite the preeminence of internal criteria in <abbr>HB</abbr> textual criticism, 
                    scholars do use external criteria to evaluate variants, often tacitly or unconsciously: 
                    stemmatic criteria are used, for example, when trying to determine the mutual dependence of witnesses which support a certain variant, 
                    while external non-stemmatic criteria are in fact employed when expressing a preference for a reading solely on the basis of the tradition that transmitted it – 
                    most often, a preference for the tradition of <abbr>M</abbr> over all others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have had recourse to both in our study.               
                    In order to evaluate the real support for a given variant, 
                    we have first attempted to reconstruct the genealogical relationships among the various witnesses,
                    to try to determine the possible cases of textual dependence. 
                    This operation was carried out on a case-by-case basis, 
                    by subdividing  into groups those witnesses which are supposed to depend either upon each other or upon a common <term>Vorlage</term>
                    (see <ptr target="#subsubsect-rdgGrp"/>).
                    By discussing these virtual <term>local stemmata</term> in our commentary,
                    we have tried to make use of external stemmatic criteria as a tool for evaluation.
                    We believe, as we have argued in § <ptr target="#subsect-limits"/>, that this is sufficient for the constitution of the Original:
                    it might then be possible to discuss the need for a comprehensive <term>stemma codicum</term> for the entire tradition,
                    as well as the possibility of statistically analysing the entire set of <term>local stemmata</term>, 
                    to measure their coherence and identify common patterns

                    Generally speaking, given a potential Hebrew variant shared by two <abbr>Versions</abbr>, 
                    we often found ourselves faced with the following situations:
                    <list type="enumerate">                        
                        <item>
                            both <abbr>Versions</abbr> derive independently from a <term>Vorlage</term> different from <abbr>M</abbr>;
                        </item>
                        <item>
                            one of the two depends on a <term>Vorlage</term>, while the other 
                            <list type="enumerate">
                                <item>was influenced by it in the composition phase (original translation)</item>
                                <item>was corrected to accord with it during the transmission phase (revision)</item>
                            </list>
                        </item>                        
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is usually difficult to distinguish between 1 and 2, distinguishing between 2(a) and 2(b) is almost impossible. 
                    The case of <abbr>P</abbr> is emblematic: this <abbr>Version</abbr> often agrees with <abbr>G</abbr>, 
                    but it is not always clear whether the agreement depends on a common <term>Vorlage</term> (1)
                    or is rather the result of Greek influence (2), either on the Syriac translator (a), or on successive generations of copyists (b).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no solid criteria to follow in these cases, and scholarly assessments often differ. 
                    In general, we have tended to exclude the dependence of one witness on another 
                    and affirm the descent of both from a common <term>Vorlage</term> when two translations, albeit similar, present substantial elements of difference,
                    or when the Hebrew reading is attested elsewhere in the tradition
                    (the criterion of external support, see § <ptr target="#subsubsect-criteria-retroversions"/>). 
                    When it is not possible to detect distinctive traits between two translations, 
                    and when the Hebrew reading of the putative common <term>Vorlage</term> is unattested, 
                    then our working hypothesis is that the two witnesses are interdependent, i.e., 
                    that contamination is taking place. 
                    It is, as can be understood, an <hi xml:lang="lat">argumentum e silentio</hi>, 
                    but in the absence of further indications of textual independence and considering the scope of the phenomenon of contamination
                    (in fact, of the influence of <abbr>G</abbr> on the rest of the tradition) this hypothesis does not seem to us unjustified.
                    On the typographical conventions adopted in the apparatus to distinguish among the various cases, see § <ptr target="#sect-crit-app"/>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the relationships between the witnesses have been established for each variant,
                    it is then possible to apply external criteria of evaluation. 
                    Among those that we present below, the first is properly stemmatic, 
                    while the others are non-stemmatic.

                                <hi rend="italics">Majority reading</hi>. 
                                This criterion establishes that the reading attested by the majority of the witnesses is to be preferred, 
                                where <quote>majority</quote> is to be understood not in an absolute way,
                                by counting the total of the witnesses in support of a certain reading, but rather, as we have stated,
                                in a stemmatic sense, by identifying the independent witnesses. 
                                We have often turned to this criterion when we have preferred the reading supported by <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>T</abbr>, 
                                which rarely share variants and are, therefore, stemmatically independent.
                            </p>     
                            <p>
                                Often, absolute majority and stemmatic majority can coincide:
                                This occurs, for example, when all the witnesses converge against one.
                                In cases like these, even if it cannot be excluded in principle that an isolated witness retains the original reading, 
                                the distribution of the witnesses strongly supports the originality of the majority reading: 
                                it is in fact more probable that a variant arose in a branch of the tradition only once,
                                rather than in several branches at the same time,
                                either independently (polygenesis) or through mutual influence (contamination).
                                One such case is in 
                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-16-d"/>, where <abbr>M</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">על ירושלם</foreign> is isolated against
                                <foreign xml:lang="hb">בירושלם</foreign> reflected in all the <abbr>Versions</abbr> and in many medieval manuscripts.

                            This criterion stipulates that preference should be given to the manuscript or tradition that, in all other cases, 
                            has better readings and has therefore proven more reliable. 
                            We did not apply this criterion in an absolute way, because all the traditions prove to be more or less corrupted in the case of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>.
                            We have not, in short, assigned a value to a specific tradition a <hi xml:lang="lat">a priori</hi>.
                            On several occasions, however, we have relied upon manuscripts or traditions that, 
                            in a specific stichos, verse, or group of verses turned out to be the least corrupted.<note type="side">Where?</note>

                            We have often applied this criterion with the readings of Qumran fragments,

                <p>
                    The most important criterion, as can be guessed, is the first: 
                    only it has sufficient strength to support, on its own,
                    the originality of a certain variant and possibly to oppose other criteria if these point towards a different solution. 
                    The other two criteria may have value in the case of equivalent readings, 
                    but we have rarely taken them into consideration if other criteria can be used.

                    A comparison with internal criteria, at any rate, is essential.

                            This general principle states that the primary reading is the one that best explains the genesis of the other competing readings. 
                            Primary does not necessarily mean original: 
                            in fact, such a reading may also be corrupted, 
                            but nevertheless it stands at the head of the textual tradition.
                            We have often used this criterion to establish the reading of the Archetype (see § <ptr target="#sect-emendatio"/>).

                            This well known text-critical heuristics states that a more difficult reading is more plausible as original than an easier one,
                            for it is more likely for a difficult reading to be trivialised during the copying process 
                            than for an easier reading to become altered into something more difficult to understand.
                            What exactly <quote>difficult</quote> means is hard to define and clearly depends on context, 
                            but the adjective is often used in scholarly studies as synonymous with unusual or rarer.
                            We understand as <term>difficilior</term> a reading that is difficult only on a linguistic – either semantic or syntactic – level, whereas
                            when we want to refer to the infrequency of a reading we speak of:

                                    When a reading is not the result of an assimilation phenomenon, that is,
                                    when it is distinct from a reading in a parallel passage which may have inadvertently influenced it
                                    (see <term>assim</term> in § <ptr target="#subsect-characterisation"/>).

                                    When a reading is not the result of a harmonisation phenomenon, that is,
                                    when it is distinct from a reading in a parallel passage which may have acted as a model for resolving a
                                    potential difficulty (see <term>harm</term> in § <ptr target="#subsect-characterisation"/>).

                            Often a reading can be both <term>difficilior</term> and non-assimilating/harmonizing, 
                            since, in fact, something difficult is ordinarily rarer, 
                            but this is not always the case.

                            <term>Lectio brevior</term>. This criterion states that a shorter reading is to be preferred, 
                            because shorter readings are more easily expanded, than longer readings shortened.
                            The main justification for this criterion lies in the natural propensity of scribes to respect 
                            the text as transmitted, possibly paraphrasing it and explaining it, but still keeping its integrity intact.

                            <term>Usus scribendi</term>. This criterion establishes that a reading more akin to the style of the author 
                            – to his vocabulary or syntax – is more likely to be original.

                            A reading is considered original when, even in the absence of a support from the same book, 
                            it nonetheless has parallels in other biblical books.

                            Often a reading is preferred because it makes better sense, 
                            either because it is in line with the Author's thought or ideology or because it is superior on a literary level.

                <p>
                    The criteria outlined so far are those most frequently cited in the scientific literature.
                    In our commentary, however, we have often justified our preference for one reading
                    over another in terms of its being <quote>the most parsimonious reading</quote> or <quote>the most parsimonious solution.</quote> 
                    By these expressions we basically mean that, among competing explanations of a given textual phenomenon, 
                    we prefer the simplest one, that is, the one that requires the fewest passages to account for the actual data.
                    Thus, for example,  between two or more possible retroversions we prefer 
                    the one that leaves the consonantal text intact to others that modify it, and 
                    between two or more possible emendations or conjectures we prefer the one that requires the least number of changes in the text. 
                    This general methodological principle, known as the principle of parsimony 
                    and traceable to Occam's razor, informs the entire genealogical model, 
                    and therefore the reconstructive philological method itself: 
                    the criterion of the stemmatic majority <hi rend="esc">{</hi>a<hi rend="esc">}</hi>
                    as well as that of the <term>utrum in alterum</term> <hi rend="esc">{</hi>A<hi rend="esc">}</hi> 
                    can be considered to be particular applications of the principle of parsimony
                    <note type="side">
                        For a discussion on the application of the parsimony principle in genealogical method,
                        see <ref target="#Robinson1996"/>

                <p>
                    All of the criteria just elaborated upon can, of course, act in combination: 
                    a shorter reading can also be more difficult and thus be expanded in order to make it more comprehensible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just as often, criteria can conflict: a reading that conforms to the <term>usus scribendi</term> can, for example, 
                    be classified as assimilation, and a reading that makes better sense can also be considered as a facilitation.
                    Internal and external criteria may conflict as well, when, for example,
                    a rarer reading is found to be isolated as against the rest of the tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many cases, such conflicts make a decision impossible, because the competing explanations are all equally plausible

                <p>
                    For each place of variation, we weigh all the various probabilities and,
                    after reviewing the history of the studies and the decisions made by other scholars, 
                    we make our own textual decision, justifying it in our textual critical commentary (see § <ptr target="#sect-commentary"/>). 
                    For the treatment of readings with equal value, we refer the reader to Section <ptr target="#subsubsect-indifferent-readings"/>.

            <p>
                The biblical Hebrew text can be seen as the product of an overlapping of three layers: 
                the consonantal text, the <term>matres lectionis</term>, and pointing (vocalisation and accentuation).
                These  layers have different objectives and were created at  distinct  moments in the transmission history. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The consonantal text represents, so to speak, the semantic skeleton of the text.
                It can be defined as a sequence of lexemes (the consonantal roots), 
                which are properly inflected to form tokens (the words) and are ordered into units of meaning (the sentences)
                in order to fulfil a communicative function and, ultimately, to convey the Author's message. 
                In this sense, the consonantal text can indeed be traced back to the ancient period.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Each token can have multiple graphic realisations. 
                These, in the absence of specific alphabetic signs for vowels, are expressed through so-called vowel letters or <term>matres lectionis</term>.
                The addition of <term>matres lectionis</term>, which dates back to the ancient period 
                and has never been stabilised or regulated even in the post-Masoretic era, 
                actually constitutes a second textual layer.
                They serve to represent <hi rend="italics">interpretations</hi> of the consonantal text: 
                they often fix its meaning, allowing disambiguation between otherwise homographic forms, 
                but can sometimes also alter it, reflecting potential variants.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Equally interpretative, and equally prone to generating variants in content as well, 
                is the function performed by pointing, 
                which represents the third and final layer, last applied to the consonantal text by the Masoretes in medieval times.                 
            </p>
            <p>
                Added to this scheme is the <hi rend="italics" xml:lang="fr">mise an page</hi>, performed by the Masoretes as well,
                which includes the disposition of the verses (stichometry) and of the paragraphing on the page.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Each of these layers is liable to change during the transmission process.
                In many instances, as with <term>matres lectionis</term> and pointing, these changes will affect the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of the text only;
                in others, they will affect the <hi rend="italics">content</hi> as well. 
                Borrowing the distinction set out by <ref target="#Greg1950"/> in his influential study and adopted by the editors of <abbr>HBCE</abbr>
                <note type="foot">
                    See <ref target="#Hendel2008">343-9</ref> and 
                    <ref target="#Hendel2013">70-8</ref>
                </note>,
                we refer to the alterations which regard the form of the text as <term>accidental variants</term>, 
                and those which also affect the meaning as <term>substantial variants</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In principle, only the substantial variants are indispensable for reconstructing the author's message: 
                spelling, vocalisation, punctuation, and <hi rend="italics" xml:lang="fr">mise an page</hi> may be relevant in many respects 
                (historical linguistics and codicology, to name two),
                but they are not necessarily the subject of investigation in a critical edition. 
                The editor is therefore free, faced with them, to adopt whatever practice he believes most congenial for his edition,
                but he is in any case obliged to adopt one, and to offer a rationale for it.
            </p>                        
            <p>
                Later in this Section, we will illustrate how we approached these aspects of the text from a theoretical point of view. 
                In Chapter <ptr target="#chap-edition"/> we set out the editorial practices adopted and the disposition of the critical edition.
            </p>
            <div type="subsection">
                <head type="title">Substantial Variants</head>
                <p>
                    The reconstruction of the Original in its substantial readings advances in two ways:
                    the selection of the preferred readings as deduced from the textual tradition, 
                    and the proposal of unattested readings if the tradition appears to be corrupted. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In traditional terminology, the first practice is termed <term>emendatio ope codicum</term> (or <term>ex libro</term>), 
                    while the second is termed <term>emendatio ope ingenii</term> (or <term>ope coniecturae</term> or <term>divinatio</term>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his influential handbook on textual criticism of the <abbr>HB</abbr>,
                    Tov questions the practice of designating the choice of a reading diverging from <abbr>M</abbr> as <quote>emendation</quote>:
                    this term, he asserts, should refer only to the choice of unattested readings in the tradition (<hi rend="italics">conjectural</hi> emendation), 
                    while if such readings are attested, one should simply speak of <quote>preferred readings</quote> and of
                    <quote>preferences of readings.</quote>
                    The designation <quote>emendation</quote> – continues Tov – 
                    should be avoided, because, even if it is true that <abbr>M</abbr> is the central text for the <abbr>HB</abbr> inasmuch as the other textual witnesses
                    are compared with it, <quote resp="#Tov2012">it is a mere convention for the scholarly world.</quote>
                    <note type="foot">
                        <ref target="#Tov2012">327-8</ref>.
                        Similar remarks have been made even earlier than Tov by <ref target="#McCarter1986">75</ref>:
                        <quote resp="#McCarter1986">When a critic rejects the reading of MT in favor of a reading in one of the versions,
                        we often say that he has emended the text.
                        In fact, however, the critic has simply adopted one of the transmitted readings; he has not proposed an emendation.
                        This is another of those infelicities that arise from our tendency to think of MT as the Hebrew text itself rather than one of the witnesses to the Hebrew Text.</quote>.
                        <!--<ref target="#Hendel2008">330-1</ref> basically agrees and speaks of <quote>reconstruction</quote> as opposed to <quote>conjecture.</quote>-->
                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would, in principle, agree with Tov's critique and adopt his terminological suggestions:
                    <quote>preferred reading</quote> is a more neutral term which well expresses the egalitarian status of the various witnesses, 
                    while <quote>emendation</quote> implies in effect the assumption of a Masorete-centric model, 
                    with <abbr>M</abbr> or <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> taken as the ultimate goal of the editorial endeavour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe nonetheless that credible arguments exist in favour of the conventional terminology, 
                    which we have adhered to deliberately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One such argument receives its justification from the model underlying <abbr>HB</abbr> ecdotics: 
                    the model of the copy-text. 
                    <abbr>M</abbr> is in fact not only our <hi rend="italics">collation text</hi>,
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the exemplar used for comparison with other witnesses 
                    and the search for variants, 
                    but also our copy-text, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, the text that we take as a mirror image, faded though it be,
                    of the original framework of the <abbr>HB</abbr>, 
                    and which we print as such in our editions, 
                    be they diplomatic or eclectic. 
                    <abbr>M</abbr> is therefore fundamental, not only, as Tov states, 
                    because all the witnesses are compared with it (collation text), 
                    but also because it represents for us the only way to access the Original Hebrew of the work; 
                    because it is, in other words, our copy-text of necessity, without which no edition of the <abbr>HB</abbr> would be conceivable. 
                    There follows from this, that when a variant is preferred to a reading of the copy-text, 
                    the critic is effectively assuming that the reading conveyed by <abbr>M</abbr> is erroneous, i.e., not original, 
                    <hi rend="italics">and he is therefore in fact emending <abbr>M</abbr></hi>.
                    Simply put: as inaccurate as it may be to say that M is being emended, what is happening is precisely that, 
                    and cannot be anything else but that, 
                    given that the ecdotics of the <abbr>HB</abbr> is underpinned on the model of the copy-text, and as such, on copy-text <abbr>M</abbr>.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    The concept of emendation can be defended not only from the point of view of the ecdotics model,
                    but also historically, from the point of view of the Original. 
                    When scholars express preferences for a reading other than the copy-text, 
                    they are not trivially correcting only the copy-text, nor even just the <term>textus receptus</term> that the copy-text is supposed to exemplify, 
                    but <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the witnesses which find themselves in disagreement with the presumed original reading. 
                    They are revising, in short, the entire textual tradition in view (of their reconstruction) of the author's Original,
                    maintaining it when it is believed that it reflects that  Original, and correcting the deviations –
                    the <hi rend="italics">errors</hi>, in the etymological sense –
                    if it is held not to. 
                    In this sense, the concept of <quote>emendation</quote> can be maintained: 
                    the binary opposition original reading/erroneous reading, however undemocratic it may be, 
                    cannot in fact be sidestepped.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    A final argument that we might mention is of a practical nature. 
                    We cannot imagine how, for example in a critical commentary, 
                    expressions such as <quote>this passage has been emended variously</quote> or <quote>many emendations have been proposed</quote>
                    or <quote>there are no bases for emendation</quote> and suchlike can be rewritten in order to match the supposedly desired egalitarian requirements.
                    <quote>Emendation</quote> should be maintained if only because it greatly simplifies scientific communication.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    In light of all these considerations, and in keeping with the traditional distinction between 
                    <term>emendatio ope codicum</term> and <term>ope ingenii</term>,
                    we have employed, here as well as in our commentary, the term
                    <quote>emendation</quote> to refer to readings that are taken from the textual tradition
                    and <quote>conjecture</quote> to refer to readings <quote>invented</quote> by scholars.
                    When it is not possible to distinguish between the two, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, when it is uncertain that a given reading
                    is actually supported by a textual witness, we tentatively classify it as conjecture.
                    When we want to refer to both emendations and conjectures, we speak generically of <quote>corrections.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We shall now shift our focus onto explaining our understanding of both of these concepts and how we have used them in our edition. 
                </p>

                    <p>
                        After we have defined the stemmatic relationships and weighed the variants, 
                        we express our preference regarding the primary readings. 
                        A primary reading can be of two types: archetypal or original.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We define as <term>archetypal</term> a reading that can be placed at the head of the transmission process
                        and that is <hi rend="italics">able to account for all the readings attested in the tradition</hi>,
                        and especially for all the possible variants.   
                        We define as <term>original</term> a reading which can not only be collocated upstream of the transmission process,
                        but which also corresponds to our understanding of the Author's intention;
                        a reading, in other words, 
                        <hi rend="italics">which we consider probable that the Author would have wanted to appear in the Original of his work, if it had existed</hi>.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        In evaluating the textual evidence for each place of variation,
                        we always try to keep the identification (or reconstruction) of the archetypal reading distinct
                        from the identification (or reconstruction) of the original reading. 
                        In fact, if it is true that an original reading is also archetypal, the contrary is not true.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An archetypal reading and an original reading coincide when,
                        among two or more competing readings, <hi rend="italics">at least one</hi> is not only able to explain the genesis of all the others (archetypal reading), 
                        but also to recreate a text in line with the style, thought, and intention of the Author (original reading). 
                        It is in cases like this that we intervene by way of <term>emendatio ope codicum</term>,
                        picking up one reading from the tradition and attempting to justify its superiority
                        over the others through the evaluation criteria set out in § <ptr target="#sect-evaluation"/>. 
                        One such case, among many others, occurs in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-9-1-a"/>,
                        where we accept the text <foreign xml:lang="hb">ולבי ראה</foreign> from <abbr>G</abbr> both as archetypal and as original: 
                        archetypal because it better explains the genesis of <foreign xml:lang="hb">ולבור</foreign> in <abbr>M</abbr> and in the rest of the <abbr>Versions</abbr> 
                        from a paleographic point of view (criterion <hi rend="esc">{</hi>A<hi rend="esc">}</hi> of the <hi xml:lang="lat">utrum in alterum</hi>); 
                        and original because it accords with the Author's phraseology.

                    <p>
                        A particular case of <term>emendatio ope codicum</term>,
                        bordering on conjecture, occurs when the archetypal/original reading is found scattered at several points in the tradition, 
                        fragmented into two or more readings.
                        In these cases, the emendation consists of a sort of conflation, known as a <term>combinatio</term>, of the readings in question. 
                        A case of <term>combinatio</term> occurs in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-3-a"/>, 
                        where the conflation of <foreign xml:lang="hb">את</foreign>, witnessed by <abbr>M</abbr>, <abbr>Sm</abbr>-<abbr>Th</abbr>, and Jerome,
                        with <foreign xml:lang="hb">אתה</foreign>, witnessed by <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>T</abbr>,
                        is likely to reflect the reading both of the Archetype and of the Original.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Archetype and Original, on the other hand, do not coincide when the reading that best explains the genesis of all the others (archetypal reading) 
                        is clearly corrupt and does not make sense, or when, even if it gives a plausible sense, 
                        it is suspect on a literary or thought level. 
                        In both cases we postulate a so-called <term>archetypal error</term> and, when possible, 
                        we repair this error by conjecture; otherwise, we place the text between <term>cruces</term>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will discuss conjecture in the next section: 
                        for now, let us conclude this section by merely noting that the Archetype can emerge not only from a reading attested in the tradition.
                        Indeed, it may happen that the Archetypal reading is only partially preserved in the tradition, 
                        and that a conjecture is required to restore it. 
                        Such a case occurs in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-9-b"/>, where the archetypal <foreign xml:lang="hb">בהמון מלא</foreign> conjectured by <ref target="#Weeks2022"/> satisfactorily 
                        explains the corrupted readings <foreign xml:lang="hb">בהמונם</foreign> by <abbr>G</abbr>
                        and <foreign xml:lang="hb">בהמון לא</foreign> by <abbr>M</abbr> and the other Versions.
                    </p>

                        The practice of conjecture, known as <term>divinatio</term> or <term>emendatio ope ingenii</term>,
                        is a generally accepted practice in textual philology, as well as in biblical philology, 
                        despite past and present objections dictated either by an attitude of excessive methodological prudence or by considerations of an ideological nature.
                        <note type="side">Bibliography</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main objective of the practice of conjecture is to attempt to resolve the corruptions of the Archetype
                        by resorting to readings that are not attested in the tradition. 
                        The fundamental requirement and justification before making the conjecture is, of course, 
                        that the text as transmitted is corrupt or suspected to be so.
                    </p>     
                    <p>
                        This is sometimes obvious, when the tradition gives us a reading that clearly does not make sense,
                        either linguistically or on the level of logic or content. 
                        In such cases, identification of the corruption is rather straightforward, 
                        and it is not uncommon to observe even the ancient witnesses engaging in an attempt to overcome it,
                        either through exegesis or through actual conjectures. 
                        An example can be found in the already mentioned case of
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-8-10-a"/>, where all the traditions, <abbr>M</abbr> included, reflect the meaningless <foreign xml:lang="hb">קברים</foreign>,
                        which is likely a corruption by metathesis of an original <foreign xml:lang="hb">קרבים</foreign>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More often, however, the tradition transmits to us a reading that is intrinsically ambiguous, 
                        oscillating between error and <quote>linguistic peculiarity.</quote>
                        In these cases it is difficult to find the balance between an attitude, so to speak, <quote>justicialist,</quote> 
                        prone to condemn, and inclined to hyper-correction, 
                        and an attitude which is <quote>justificationist,</quote> 
                        one which ends up legitimizing and often preferring as original the most problematic readings and,
                        even sometimes, more incomprehensible. 
                        This second attitude is rather widespread in the critical literature on <abbr>HB</abbr>, 
                        and it is particularly difficult to oppose because, 
                        as Fox reminds us, <quote>it is always possible to make reason of the M[asoretic] T[ext]</quote>.
                    </p>     
                    <p>
                        Just as often it can happen that the tradition is unanimous in attesting a reading that is, apparently, free from problems.
                        These are the most difficult cases to identify, because, as McCarter says, 
                        it is precisely in the nature of the error <quote resp="#McCarter1986">to produce ordinary, commonplace, or <quote>easy</quote> reading.</quote>
                        These are also the cases in which it is more difficult to justify the scholar's intervention, 
                        because the corruption must of course be demonstrated, both with philological and literary arguments. 
                        An example of this type is found in our opinion in
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-4-16-a"/>, where the transmitted reading <foreign xml:lang="hb">העם</foreign> does indeed make sense,
                        but not a few elements related to the author's style and thought seem to favor the originality of a conjectural <foreign xml:lang="hb">העמל</foreign>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the whole, as will be seen, we have made little use of conjecture in our edition,
                        not because we distrust conjectural practice or because we harbour conservative concerns regarding the text as transmitted, 
                        but rather because of the peculiarity of the text of <abbr>Qoh</abbr>. 
                        Difficult passages, for which neither context nor tradition offers any help at all, 
                        are notoriously numerous in this particular book,
                        and although some of the conjectures proposed manage <hi xml:lang="lat">prima facie</hi> to resolve these difficulties and even to make plausible sense, 
                        most have not seemed to us to be sufficiently justified, let alone definitive.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        We have not even reported many of the conjectures encountered during our review of the secondary literature. 
                        Indeed, as we have explained above (§ <ptr target="#sect-search"/>), 
                        we have never even considered opening an apparatus entry unless we felt there was at least a hint of textual variation in the tradition. 
                        This choice on our part can be contested in the light of what has just been said about the nature of error, but, for the same reasons given above,
                        we believe that it is justified in the specific case of Qohelet —
                        and not only, of course, because taking account of every conjecture  is virtually impossible, 
                        and would require a different collation with that specific goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The conjectures that we propose in our collation, therefore,
                        are only a selection among the many proposed in the literature 
                        and concern only those places where the tradition is discordant or the text clearly corrupted. 
                        The conjectures that we have accepted as text are very few and, in our opinion, they are the surest.
                        However, we have reported all those cases in which we believe with certainty or suspect that the text is corrupt, 
                        relegating the relevant text affected by the corruption between <term>cruces</term>.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        At times, as can be seen, we have even sometimes proposed to expunge passages in the critical text, 
                        when we considered some words to be interpolations or glosses, 
                        and more generally non-authorial additions.
                        These are judgements based on arguments of a literary nature, 
                        which some critics may not be slow to consider pertinent more to literary criticism than to textual criticism. 
                        The boundary between the two forms of criticism is, however, subtle, and not always clear:
                        even if, as we have stated, our edition is mainly based on an examination of the tradition and remains close to it in the <term>emendatio</term>,
                        we have not deemed it unjustified, also in light of the intentionalist paradigm that we have made our own,
                        to advance a few conjectures that attempt to bring the text closer to (what we believe to be) the author's Original.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In many cases, not only is it not possible to remedy the corruption,
                        but not even to properly evaluate all the variants.
                        Often, in fact, neither are the causes that led to the emergence of certain variants clear,
                        nor the direction followed by the textual change. 
                        Faced with all these cases of <term>indifferent readings</term>, we imagine as practicable the following three possible paths:                                         
                        <list type="enumerate">
                            <item>
                                to select the reading of the witness or group of witnesses which proves, on the whole, to be more reliable; in other words,
                                to follow the criterion <hi rend="esc">{</hi>b<hi rend="esc">}</hi> of the <term>best manuscript/tradition reading</term>,
                                see § <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>;
                            </item>
                            <item>
                                to choose the reading of the most ancient witness or group of witnesses, according to the criterion
                                <hi rend="esc">{</hi>b<hi rend="esc">}</hi> of the <term>most ancient reading</term>;
                            </item>
                            <item>
                                to conserve the reading of <abbr>M</abbr> by default.
                            </item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first option rests on a kind of statistical argument: 
                        in the case of total equivalence among variants,
                        it is more probable that the correct reading is the one handed down by the witness which, in all other cases, 
                        has preserved the best variants.
                        The editor is then led to choose the readings of that witness, but <quote>he can also do so without regret</quote> –
                        comments Fränkel – <quote>because in those cases it does not matter in the least whether the text contains this or that expression.</quote>                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second option rests on philological grounds: 
                        <abbr>M</abbr> is the latest witness of the biblical text and, even considering that <hi xml:lang="lat">recentior non deterior</hi>, 
                        the possibility of an accumulation of secondary readings due to copying activity is stronger for <abbr>M</abbr>
                        than witnesses that are more ancient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third option, which is the one traditionally adopted, is the most conservative, and, 
                        when it does not spring from a preconceived adherence to <abbr>M</abbr> or is taken uncritically, 
                        can be supported by two arguments: 
                        the first is that, however late, <abbr>M</abbr> still represents the most important direct source,
                        written in the original language of the biblical text, Hebrew; 
                        the second is that <abbr>M</abbr>, as a religious text, has presumably been faithfully transmitted since the ancient period;
                        in other words, that the tradition of <abbr>M</abbr>, to use Varvaro's well-known formulation,
                        is a <term>quiescent tradition</term>, and therefore sufficiently stable and reliable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first option, as we have said (<ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>),
                        does not really appertain to <abbr>Qoh</abbr>, 
                        because all textual traditions have been affected, 
                        to a more or less equivalent degree, by secondary and corrupted readings. 
                        It therefore did not seem wise to us, except on very rare occasions, 
                        confined to limited sections of the text, to extend this principle to all cases of indifferent variants.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second option, conversely, does not seem to us to be entirely impracticable: 
                        given that our fundamental objective is to reconstruct the oldest possible text, 
                        recourse to the readings of more ancient traditions of <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                        such as the Greek, is in principle defensible. 
                        The only real argument that we can adduce to the contrary is the fact that a large number of the witnesses of the biblical text,
                        and the most important of them, namely, the <abbr>Versions</abbr>, are indirect sources, 
                        and that any retroversion or emendation based on them is of necessity conjectural.
                        To accept a versional variant in all those cases – and there are many – 
                        in which the variants are equivalent could result in an operation, in the case of semantically irrelevant variants,
                        which would seem to us rather gratuitous, and in the case of more significant variants, rather arbitrary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On balance, except for a very few cases in which we have chosen, <hi xml:lang="lat">ceteris paribus</hi>,
                        to accept the readings attested at Qumran, we have preferred to stick with the third option, 
                        leaving <abbr>M</abbr> undisturbed whenever the variants seem to us to be equivalent.
                        This decision on our part, we would like to clarify, is not, however, due to an <hi xml:lang="lat">a priori</hi> preference for <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                        but is imposed by our ignorance of the reading to be preferred, as well as by our inability of using the philological method to determine it.

                <p>
                    Those who wish to reconstruct the Original of a biblical book, 
                    and especially those who wish to do so through an eclectic edition, 
                    must make precise choices not only regarding the consonantal text,
                    but also regarding the accidentals, namely spelling (vowel letters), pointing (vocalisation and accentuation), 
                    and <hi rend="italics" xml:lang="fr">mise en page</hi> (versification and disposition of paragraphs on the page).
                    Even if these are not directly the goal of philological reconstruction, they are nonetheless an integral part of the text,
                    and are sometimes crucial to enable its comprehension and to convey the Author’s message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below we briefly explain the policy we have adopted in matters of accidentals, 
                    making a quick comparison with normal practices and discussing the main reasons behind these.

                <div type="subsubsection" xml:id="subsub-spelling">
                    <head type="title">Spelling</head>
                    <p>
                        As for spelling, we found ourselves confronted with two possible alternatives:
                        adopting a scientific, <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, normalised, spelling of the Hebrew, 
                        taking modern Hebrew as our model, 
                        or maintaining the spelling and vocalisation of our copy-text, namely
                        <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The latter option is the most widely adopted in the ecdotics of the <abbr>HB</abbr>:
                        as far as we know, <ref target="#Garbini1992"/>'s critical edition of the Canticle is the only one that adopts a normalised spelling of the Hebrew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The principal reason adduced by scholars who use <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> as their copy-text 
                        is that this is a compromise solution, <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> being not only the most ancient, dated, complete manuscript of the <abbr>HB</abbr>,
                        but also the one most used by the scholarly community. 
                        Another reason concerns the critical text/apparatus reference system: 
                        especially if the edition is eclectic, it is clear that a discrepancy would arise between the normalised spelling of the critical text 
                        and the actual spelling of the readings in the apparatus

                            So <ref target="#Borbone1990">36</ref>.
                        </note>. 
                        The choice to follow of copy-text, therefore, seems to be dictated more by practical considerations than by scientific reasoning.

                    <p>
                        Taking the lead from Garbini, we wanted to try our hand at normalising the Hebrew spelling of our critical text,
                        essentially opting for a plene spelling of nouns and verbs as in modern Hebrew. 
                        Since these are minimal and easily recognizable modifications, 
                        we do not believe that they significantly hinder the identification of the lemma of the critical text in the apparatus,
                        thanks also to the special reference system we have adopted (see § <ptr target="#sect-crit-app"/>).
                    </p>                    
                    
                    <p>
                        We have refrained from applying normalisation only in those cases where the text is corrupted and placed between <term>cruces</term>
                        (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">שדה ושדות</foreign> in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-8-c"/>) 
                        or when a particular spelling is able to explain the occurrence of certain variants in the tradition
                        (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">עשהו</foreign> in 
                        <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-12-g"/>).
                        In the first case, we have followed the spelling of <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>:
                        since these are corruptions, it would not make sense to normalise the spelling. 
                        In the second case we have adopted the spelling that we have considered to be historically more plausible: 
                        this decision can be justified by the fact that, in these cases, 
                        the addition of the <term>matres lectionis</term> does not constitute a mere matter of accidentals, 
                        but falls fully within the treatment of the substantials.

                    <p>
                        As far as pointing is concerned, there are essentially two practicable ways to treat it: 
                        to reproduce the pointing of the copy-text or leave the text unpointed. 
                        The copy-text method is, here too, the majority practice among the editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>. 
                        We have preferred to follow the second path, but with some limitations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the Masoretic pointing does not constitute a variant – 
                        when, that is, the pointing is in fact comparable to Greg's accidentals – 
                        we have omitted it, leaving the critical text unpointed. 
                        On the other hand, when the pointing affects the meaning, and when, in the tradition, 
                        variants concerning it are attested,
                        we have reproduced it, both in the lemma of the critical text and in the variants in the apparatus.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        The reason for the first decision is theoretical.
                        It is common knowledge that pointing is a very late phenomenon:
                        to reproduce it <hi rend="italics">systematically</hi> in the critical text did not seem to us correct in terms of method,
                        because it might not only favour, willy-nilly, the identification of the Original with <abbr>M</abbr>,
                        but also lead one to think that the reconstruction we have undertaken concerns the Masoretic pointing as well.
                        In other words: that the pointing of the reconstructed text is the original vocalisation of <abbr>M</abbr>,
                        which, as we said (§ <ptr target="#sect-search"/>), is not true in our case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our second decision responds instead to a practical exigency: 
                        in our system it becomes easier to call the attention of the reader to the existence of variants concerning pointing,
                        but which leave the consonantal text virtually intact. 
                        Within this system, the use of the Tiberian masoretic pointing is merely a technical expedient: 
                        we could have used, with the same effect, Palestinian, say, or Yemenite, or Babylonian pointing. 
                        This use of Tiberian pointing can claim additional justification within the intentionalist paradigm we have adhered to: 
                        as <ref target="#Fox2015">20</ref> so nicely puts it,
                        the pointing represents, ideally, the way the author <hi rend="italics">would have</hi>
                        pointed the consonantal had he had the Tiberian pointing system at his disposal.

                    <p>
                        We have not taken into account either the arrangement in lines (stichometry)

                        Our critical text, therefore, is continuous, with the sole exception of a simple indentation at the beginning of each chapter, 
                        which is merely a visual aid to the reader.

            Here, we discuss how we have divided our work, 
            following the method we have just described. 
            We present the discrete parts (collation, commentary, critical text with apparatus, and translation), 
            explaining how we have organised the data and how to read them.

        <div type="section">
            <head type="title">The Collation</head>
            <p>
                The collation contains lists of biblical verses followed by one or more apparatus entries.
                Each apparatus entry consists of a lemma, which links the apparatus entry to the verse,  and two apparatuses.
                The first apparatus collects the variants inferred from the systematic comparison between our collation exemplar (<abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>) 
                and the textual witnesses, putting into concrete practice the method outlined in Section <ptr target="#sect-search"/>.
                The second gathers together a large number of the  retroversions, emendations, and conjectures proposed in the secondary literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us move on now to describe in more detail how an apparatus entry is organised,
                explaining its rationale and the typographical conventions adopted.

            <div type="subsection" xml:id="subsect-lemma">
                <head type="title">The Lemma</head>
                <p>
                    The lemma specifies that portion of the biblical verse towards which variants converge,
                    and is preceded by the number of the chapter and verse and is closed by a square bracket.
                    The variants are evidenced by using a system reminiscent of that of the  <abbr>BHS</abbr>,
                    with a single  Latin letter immediately following the lemma if this consists of just one word
                    (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <quote><hi rend="supMath">a</hi><foreign xml:lang="hb">הקהלת</foreign>]</quote> in
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-2-a"/>),
                    or more letters if it consists of more words
                    (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <quote><hi rend="supMath">a</hi><foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך בירושלים</foreign><hi rend="supMath">a</hi>]</quote> in
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-1-a"/>).  
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a discussion is dedicated to the variant in our textual comment, 
                    we place the arrow <quote><hi rend="supMath"><metamark rend="nearrow">↗</metamark></hi></quote> after the square bracket,
                    and if the variant is accepted in our critical apparatus, we pose the icon <quote><abbr>crit</abbr></quote>.
                    Both symbols are active hyperlinks in the present PDF copy, 
                    so that by clicking on them the reader is taken to the corresponding entries in the commentary and in the apparatus, respectively.

                    The first apparatus consists of lists of reading groups, each of which contains the readings of the witnesses as cited in their original languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here below, we will first describe the general criteria used to subdivide the readings into groups (§ <ptr target="#subsubsect-rdgGrp"/>),
                    as well as the treatment reserved to several special cases, such as 
                    the <term>K<hi rend="sup">e</hi>thîb</term>/<term>Q<hi rend="sup">e</hi>rê</term> (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-ketib-qere"/>),
                    the conflations (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-conflations"/>), 
                    and the indeterminate witnesses (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-uncertain-readings"/>).
                    We then go on to illustrate the conventions we adopted for citing the readings (§ <ptr target="#subsubsect-rdg"/>),
                    focusing in particular on certain complex traditions, among them the Greek (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-medieval-mss"/>)
                    and the medieval Hebrew  (§ <ptr target="#subsubsub-medieval-mss"/>).

                    <p>
                        All of the readings in the collation are divided into groups and eventual sub-groups. 
                        We distinguish a first-level grouping and two second- and third-level groupings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first-level grouping is performed for the purpose of bringing together those witnesses which share the same readings,
                        assigning to them the <term>Vorlage</term> on which they are presumed to depend. 
                        Each group is indicated by a Roman numeral (<abbr>e.g.</abbr>  <quote>I</quote>, <quote>II</quote> etc.), followed by its <term>Vorlage</term>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first of these groups contains witnesses which are found to agree with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>, 
                        and is always present in an apparatus entry. 
                        If none of the witnesses agrees with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>
                        or in case alignment with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> is impossible (see below), 
                        then the first group is left empty, and a long horizontal stroke  (<quote>—</quote>) takes its place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first group is followed by the groups of other witnesses, arranged in the following order:
                        <abbr>Q</abbr>, <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>Syh</abbr>, the Revisors, <abbr>P</abbr>, Jerome, <abbr>T</abbr>, and the medieval manuscripts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example of a first-level grouping is in <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-3-b"/>, where <abbr>G</abbr>, <abbr>P</abbr>, Jerome, and <abbr>T</abbr> 
                        agree with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">השמש</foreign>
                        (group <quote>I</quote>), whereas <abbr>Syh</abbr> and codex <hi xml:lang="lat">Ambrosianus</hi> (manuscript 7a1) share a variant
                        which can be traced back to a common <term>Vorlage</term> <foreign xml:lang="hb">השמים</foreign> (group <quote>II</quote>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First-level groupings are <hi rend="italics">always</hi> accompanied by a proposal for the reconstruction of the <term>Vorlage</term>,
                        even if this is highly conjectural (The only exception is <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-15-b"/>, for which we are not able to think of a plausible <term>Vorlage</term>).
                        Each proposal comes with a probabilistic evaluation, according to the criteria and conventions set out in Section <ptr target="#subsect-var-non-var"/>.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        Within a first-level group, as we have stated, 
                        there may possibly be two types of sub-groups. 
                        Both are signalled by an indentation which recalls the structure of the <abbr>XML</abbr> encoding,
                        and which, in our opinion, facilitates the reading of the apparatus.
                    </p>            
                    <p>
                        The second- and third-level groupings respond to different objectives.
                        The goal of the second level is to indicate that the witnesses of the sub-group do not depend on a <term>Vorlage</term> of their own, 
                        but rather go back to the <term>Vorlage</term> of the main group. 
                        These witnesses are, however, separated from the others,
                        either because they share some translational features which may possibly reveal a reciprocal influence
                        (such as in the case of <abbr>Sm</abbr> influencing <abbr>V</abbr>)
                        or are the result of inner-corruption phenomena. 
                        Sub-groups of this level are indicated by a Latin lowercase letter surrounded by parentheses,
                        <abbr>e.g.</abbr>:  <quote>(a)</quote>, <quote>(b)</quote>, <quote>(c)</quote> etc.
                        The order of placement of these sub-groups is the same as mentioned above: 
                        only when the readings in question are the result of internal corruption
                        are these sub-groups placed at the end of the main grouping to which they belong  (see an example in the Figure below).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third-level sub-grouping is meant to signal that the witnesses belong to the same textual tradition.
                        It therefore does not have a precise philological function,
                        but simply serves to clearly organise the data. 
                        Sub-groupings of this type are often used to bring together the readings of <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>Syh</abbr>, 
                        the readings of the Revisors transmitted in Greek and Syriac,
                        the readings of the manuscripts of <abbr>T</abbr> and of <abbr>M</abbr>, and so on.
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        An example that includes all the types of groupings just described is in <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-17-b"/>,
                        an extract of which is reported in the Figure below
                        (For reasons of space, we show only the first group <quote>I</quote>, which is that of the witnesses which agree with <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>).

                        As can be seen, within this first group, three other groups are visible: two are of the third level,
                        and collect the readings of <abbr>Aq</abbr> and <abbr>Th</abbr> in various languages and from various sources; 
                        another is second-level, and contains the reading of the greater part of the Greek tradition – <abbr>G</abbr> and <abbr>Syh</abbr>. 
                        Then there are two unpaired readings, that of the Greek manuscript 788, 
                        accepted by Gentry in his critical apparatus (<quote>Ge</quote>), and that of Jerome in his commentary (<abbr>Hi</abbr>). 
                        While these readings as well as those of <abbr>Aq</abbr> and <abbr>Th</abbr> support <abbr>M</abbr> literally, the Greek reading is semantically poles apart:
                        <quote>parables, teachings</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="gr">παραβολὰς</foreign>)
                        versus <abbr>M</abbr> <quote>follies</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="hb">הוֹלֵלוֹת</foreign>). 
                        Such a difference is almost certainly due to an inner-corruption from an original <foreign xml:lang="gr">παραφορὰς</foreign>
                        rather than to a Hebrew <term>Vorlage</term>,
                        which is why we place <abbr>G</abbr> under <abbr>M</abbr> and within a separate group.

                            These represent cases of opposition between real textual variants and we have treated them as such. 
                            For each place where this opposition appears, we always distinguish the lemma in <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>, 
                            of which we only show the consonantal text, from the <term>K<hi rend="sup">e</hi>thîb</term>,
                            to which we assign the vocalisation we deem most probable, 
                            and finally from the <term>Q<hi rend="sup">e</hi>rê</term>, with the Masoretic vocalisation. 
                            <term>Vorlagen</term> from other witnesses are, when possible, identified as in other cases.                            
                            We have excluded from the collation the case of  <term>K<hi rend="sup">e</hi>thîb</term>/<term>Q<hi rend="sup">e</hi>rê</term> in

                        <p>
                            Conflations, i.e., those cases in which a reading results from the union of two (or potentially more) variants, 
                            call for special treatment. 
                            The cases of possible conflation that we have detected in <abbr>Qoh</abbr> are the following:  
                            <ptr type="app" target="#app-4-10-c"/> (<abbr>P</abbr>),
                            <ptr type="app" target="#app-4-14-a"/> (<abbr>V</abbr>),
                            <ptr type="app" target="#app-7-2-d"/> (<abbr>P</abbr>),
                            <ptr type="app" target="#app-9-2-a"/> (<abbr>P</abbr>), and
                            <ptr type="app" target="#app-10-1-e"/> (<abbr>Syh</abbr>).
                        </p>                        
                        <p>
                            The conflated readings are placed in a separate group and their Vorlage is indicated as the union of the numeric labels
                            of the reading groups from which they are supposed to derive.
                            Thus, for example, <abbr>P</abbr>'s reading in <ptr type="app" target="#app-4-10-c"/> is placed in a separate group numbered <quote>III</quote>, 
                            and its <term>Vorlage</term> is indicated as 
                            <quote><term>Vorlage</term>: I + II</quote>, 
                            so as to signal that <abbr>P</abbr> conflates <abbr>M</abbr> (group <quote>I</quote>) with <abbr>G</abbr> (group <quote>II</quote>).
                        </p>                        
                        <p>
                            The probability that the conflated reading depends on the union of Hebrew variants, 
                            and that therefore the conflation took place at the level of the <term>Vorlagen</term>,
                            or on the union of <abbr>M</abbr> with a variant deduced directly from the <abbr>Versions</abbr> 
                            obviously depends on the probability assigned to the individual <term>Vorlagen</term>.
                            Only in the case of <abbr>V</abbr> in <ptr type="app" target="#app-4-14-a"/> is a Hebrew variant absolutely to be excluded.

                            It is not always possible to make a pronouncement  on the <term>Vorlagen</term> underlying the translations 
                            and sometimes not even on the readings handed down in Hebrew.
                            Some readings are in fact indeterminable, 
                            either because the translation techniques are not literal enough, as frequently happens,
                            for example, in the case of <abbr>V</abbr>, or because the alignment between source-language (the Hebrew) 
                            and target-language (the languages of the <term>Versions</term>) is impossible, 
                            as in the case of variants concerning the article, obviously absent in Latin.

                            At other times an analysis is not feasible because the data available to us are insufficient: 
                            this can happen when the reading given is mutilated due to a defect in the written support
                            (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> a lacuna or illegible text in Qumran scrolls and the Greek Hamburg papyrus), 
                            or to a corruption due to copying (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> in the case of homeoteleuton), 
                            or when the reading has been transmitted to us incompletely (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> with the Revisors).

                        <p>
                            Readings of this sort are placed in groups marked as <quote>indet</quote> and <quote>insuff,</quote> respectively, 
                            and always appear at the end of the apparatus entry.

                            which is indeterminate because it lacks specification of the pointing, and, on the other, 
                            by the reading of the Hamburg papyrus, insufficient due to a lacuna.

                                Our access to the Greek documentation is necessarily
                                mediated by the critical editions of G, and in particular by the edition of Gentry. 
                                The use of critical editions is as inevitable as it is problematic, 
                                both because editors segment the text differently and because the critical apparatus, 
                                often negative, is not always easy to decipher.

                                On several occasions we needed to reconstruct by ourselves the apparatus entries of <abbr>G</abbr>'s text, 
                                so as to be able to cite the variants that interested us in our apparatus. 
                                We discuss one of these cases in full below, to give an idea of the type of operation carried out and the difficulties it entails.
                                For the other cases, which we list at the end of the Section, we refer the reader to the aforementioned critical edition.

                                In correspondence with the Hebrew lemma <foreign xml:lang="hb">וזרח</foreign> in
                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-5-a"/> there are three variants, 
                                which concern the presence/absence of the conjunction and the perfect/present tense alternation of the verb. 
                                The first variant is that of witnesses, such as <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                                who read a conjunction + the past tense (<foreign xml:lang="hb">וְזָרַח</foreign>, <abbr>lit.</abbr> <quote><hi rend="italics">and has risen</hi> the sun</quote>); 
                                the second is that of <abbr>T</abbr>, who reads a conjunction + the present 
                                (<foreign xml:lang="hb">וְזֹרֵ͏חַ</foreign>, <quote><hi rend="italics">and rises</hi> the sun</quote>), 
                                the third is that of <abbr>P</abbr> and Jerome, who read a present without a conjunction
                                (<foreign xml:lang="hb">זֹרֵ͏חַ</foreign>, <quote><hi rend="italics">rises</hi> the sun</quote>). 
                                All three variants are found in Greek, and Gentry signals their presence in the apparatus in this way, 
                                assigning an entry to the conjunction and another to the tense, respectively:

                            <p>
                                Now, it is clear that, in order to sensibly cite the Greek witnesses in our apparatus, 
                                we must combine Gentry's two apparatus entries, because conjunction and verb, in Hebrew, obviously constitute a single word. 
                                The witnesses of the first group are easy to identify: 
                                only manuscript 542 and <abbr>Syh</abbr> read a perfect (<foreign xml:lang="gr">ἀνέτειλεν</foreign>), 
                                and manuscript 542 belongs to the so-called mixed codices, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> it is isolated.
                                To identify the witnesses of the second group, however, 
                                we must take both those who read conjunction + present (<foreign xml:lang="gr">καὶ ἀνατέλλει</foreign>) 
                                and those who read conjunction + future (<foreign xml:lang="gr">καὶ ἀνατελεῖ</foreign>). 
                                The first will be indicated simply with <quote><abbr>G</abbr></quote>, 
                                because <foreign xml:lang="gr">καὶ ἀνατέλλει</foreign> is the text accepted by Gentry and Gentry's apparatus is negative. 
                                The second must be identified by taking the witnesses who read the future (<quote><foreign xml:lang="gr">ανατελει</foreign></quote>) 
                                and subtracting from them those which do not have the conjunction (<quote>om <foreign xml:lang="gr">και</foreign> 1°</quote>), 
                                i.e. manuscripts 68 415-571 311 338 728. 
                                The witnesses of the third group will be all those indicated by Gentry as lacking the conjunction,
                                but some will read the future (<foreign xml:lang="gr">ἀνατελεῖ</foreign>) and others the present (<foreign xml:lang="gr">ἀνατέλλει</foreign>). 
                                To identify them correctly, one must subtract from the group of witnesses 
                                which omit the conjunction those who read the present and the future, respectively. 
                                These will be manuscripts 125-130, on the one hand, and all the others, minus 125-130, on the other. 
                                Since manuscripts 125-130 belong to the group of Lucian manuscripts (L), 
                                the correct witness list will therefore be: 
                                C <hi rend="italics">L</hi><hi rend="sup">-125-130</hi> 390-601-789<hi rend="sup">c</hi>-<hi rend="italics">cII</hi>
                                342 411 547 645 etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other cases in which we had to intervene on the text of Gentry's apparatus in a similar way to the one just described are:

                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-19-b"/>,
                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-8-c"/>,

                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-10-15-b"/>, and
                                <ptr type="app" target="#app-10-19-a"/>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another difference that the reader will notice with respect to Gentry's edition
                                concerns the order of appearance of the witnesses in the apparatus. 
                                In principle, the order we present is the same, but, due to data encoding needs, this can sometimes vary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As we stated in Section <ptr target="#subsect-degree"/>, 
                                we have not taken into account the variants judged to be phenomena within each individual tradition.
                                It may happen, however, that some such variants affect other variants that we did take into consideration in our collation.
                                To avoid a needless proliferation of Greek quotations and an excessive fragmentation of the apparatus, 
                                we do not report these variants in full, but rather indicate their presence by means of asterisks.
                                An example is in <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-17-c"/>, where <foreign xml:lang="gr"><seg type="Var"><w>ᾧ</w> <w>ἐὰν</w></seg></foreign> 
                                indicates the presence of minor variants linked to the relative pronoun and to the conjunction and 
                                irrelevant for the reconstruction of Hebrew.

                                The readings of the Revisors are taken mainly from Gentry's edition, 
                                whose conventions we adopt.
                                It is worth remembering here the use of angle brackets,
                                to indicate that the hexaplaric reading is a retroversion from Syriac and, more rarely, from Jerome's Latin.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It may happen that several readings or retroversions are attested for the same Revisor.
                                In this case, the provenance or authorship of the readings is indicated in the textual commentary, 
                                in the section <quote>Proposed reconstructions and evaluations</quote>  (see § <ptr target="#sect-commentary"/>).

                    <p>
                        In addition to grouping the readings, we also provide a linguistic description of the variants,
                        with two main purposes: 
                        to highlight cases in which two or more witnesses share common features, not necessarily due to <term>Vorlage</term>;
                        and to make explicit what we think the variation consists of.
                        The linguistic annotation is displayed next to the reading group in the form of abbreviations preceded by hashtags, 
                        as we are about to show, and is performed by taking <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> as the term of comparison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two parts compose the linguistic annotation:
                        the type of textual change and the part of speech prone to variation.
                        The types of textual change are: 
                        addition (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>add</hi>),
                        deletion (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>del</hi>),
                        substitution (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>subst</hi>),
                        and transposition (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>trasp</hi>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The parts of speech identified are:
                        noun (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>n</hi>),
                        adjective (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>adj</hi>),
                        verb (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>v</hi>),
                        pronoun (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>prn</hi>),
                        particle (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>part</hi>), and
                        span (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>span</hi>),
                        the last involving more than one part of speech at a time
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pronouns can be divided in turn into:
                        personal (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>ps</hi>),
                        possibly in suffixes (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>suff</hi>),
                        relative (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>rl</hi>),
                        interrogative (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>interr</hi>),
                        demonstrative (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>dm</hi>),
                        whereas particles can be divided into: 
                        articles (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>art</hi>),
                        conjunctions (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>cj</hi>),
                        prepositions (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>prep</hi>),
                        adverbs (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>adv</hi>),
                        and <term>nota accusativi</term> (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>notaAcc</hi>).
                        Among the conjunctions, we further distinguish between the negative conjunction <foreign xml:lang="hb">לא</foreign>
                        (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>neg</hi>),
                        and the copulative conjunction <foreign xml:lang="hb">ו</foreign> (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>cop</hi>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Addition and deletion apply straightforwardly to the parts of speech just mentioned:
                        thus, <abbr>e.g.</abbr>, the annotation <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>add</hi></quote> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>n</hi>
                        means <quote>addition of noun</quote>; 
                        <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>del</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>prn</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>suff</hi></quote> 
                        means <quote>deletion of a suffix personal pronoun</quote>;
                        <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>add</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>part</hi>
                            <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>cj</hi><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>cop</hi></quote>
                        means <quote>deletion of the copulative conjunction <foreign xml:lang="hb">ו</foreign></quote>;
                        and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for substitution, we distinguish between semantic substitution (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>sem</hi>),
                        which denotes a change in meaning,
                        and morphological substitution  (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>morph</hi>), 
                        which denotes a change in the morphology, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> in number (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>nb</hi>: singular, plural, dual),
                        in gender (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>gn</hi>: masculine, feminine, neuter), 
                        and in tense (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>tense</hi>: present, past, etc.).
                        Some examples of substitutions found in the collation are:
                        <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>subst</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>sem</hi>
                            <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>n</hi></quote> <quote>semantic substitution of a noun</quote>;
                        <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>sub</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>morph</hi>
                            <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>nb</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>v</hi></quote>
                        <quote>morphological substitution of the number of a verb</quote>;
                        <quote><hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>sub</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>morph</hi>
                            <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>tense</hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>v</hi></quote>
                        <quote>morphological substitution of the tense of a verb</quote>.
                        When the variant goes back to a different vocalisation of the same Hebrew text,
                        we mark it accordingly as <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#</hi>voc</hi>.
                        When a reading turns out to be a complex rewording of the Hebrew, 
                        we mark it as a <quote>semantic substitution of a span</quote> 
                        (<hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#sub</hi></hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#sem</hi></hi> <hi rend="texttt"><hi rend="esc">#span</hi></hi>).

                    The readings contained in the secondary literature are grouped in a second level of apparatus placed after the list of testimonial readings. 
                    Here, we report retroversion proposals (<quote><hi rend="italics">Rt</hi></quote>), 
                    emendations to the text based on the tradition  (<quote><hi rend="italics">Em</hi></quote>),
                    and conjectures (<quote><hi rend="italics">Ct</hi></quote>).

                <p>
                    For each reading of each group we report, in chronological order, 
                    the bibliographic source from which the reading is drawn. 
                    We have particularly taken into account certain sources in collecting the material,
                    systematically consulting them for each place of variation, either because they are the first to deal with properly textual problems –
                    and therefore the first to propose philological reconstructions – 
                    or because, on the contrary, they are the most recent and updated.

                    By systematically reporting the solutions proposed by these scholars,

                        Taking all of these data into account is practically impossible,

                    <p>
                        If in the case of retroversions and emendations we have aimed for exhaustiveness, 
                        for conjectures we have had to make choices:
                        the conjectures proposed, especially by early scholars, are in fact very numerous. 
                        We have privileged those which seem more likely to us and which adhere as closely as possible to the text.
                        We have not taken into account, for example,  
                        conjectures <term>metri causa</term> or others that attempt a recomposition of the book
                        in compliance with criteria of literary criticism and source criticism.

                        The distinction between emendation and conjecture, which we have outlined in Section <ptr target="#subsubsect-emendatio-ope-codicum"/>, is of course our own. 
                        In classifying a proposed correction as either emendation or conjecture 
                        we have tried as much as possible to follow the indications of the individual scholar,
                        opting for emendation when supporting ancient sources are cited, and for conjecture otherwise.
                        Often, however, scholars propose a correction that is clearly an emendation from tradition,
                        but fail to cite the sources on which it is based. In such cases it is we who have decided, 
                        on the basis of our own evaluation of the variants, 
                        whether it is actually drawn from tradition or not, and if so, on which witnesses in particular.

            <head type="title">The Textual Commentary</head>
            <p>
                The textual commentary can be considered the heart of the edition. 
                It is there where we put into practice and debate the principles and criteria outlined throughout Chapter <ptr target="#chap-method"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The comment follows the collation, rather than the critical text and the apparatus, 
                for a very specific reason, namely, that
                we conceive of it as a place for discussing all the variants gathered into the collation,
                even those that are revealed, in the last analysis, to be non-variant. 
                Some of these non-variants (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <foreign xml:lang="hb">שואף</foreign> in 
                <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-5-b"/>) do deserve discussion,
                but should not figure in a critical apparatus, in our opinion: 
                anchoring the commentary to the critical apparatus would have required us to also mention in the apparatus even non-variants of this sort
                (see how the case of <foreign xml:lang="hb">שואף</foreign> and other similar variants are quoted in the <abbr>BHQ</abbr>).
            </p>            
            <p>
                In our commentary, we have tried to deal principally with problems of a textual nature and have refrained — 
                to the extent possible in the case of a text as difficult as <abbr>Qoh</abbr> — from entering too much into exegetical and translational issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                The commentary starts off by showing the lemma for which variants are attested according to the same conventions adopted in the collation
                (§ <ptr target="#subsect-lemma"/>).
                As in the collation, the lemma is followed by the icons <quote><abbr>coll</abbr></quote> and <quote><abbr>crit</abbr></quote>, 
                which lead respectively to the collation and, if the variant has some claims to be authentic, to the critical apparatus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The discussion is arranged in paragraphs, the structure of which is inspired by Barthélemy's <hi rend="italics">Critique Textuelle</hi>. 
                Each paragraph is preceded by a symbol which is used in the body of the comment as an abbreviation. 
                In total, there are eight possible paragraphs, but only the first is found in all commentary notes.
            </p>            
            <p>
                We present below the list of paragraphs with a brief discussion of the content of each.
                <list type="enumerate">
                    <item>
                        The ancient witnesses (symbol: <abbr>rec</abbr>). 
                        In this paragraph we present and translate the readings of the various witnesses, 
                        highlighting similarities and differences according to the grouping proposed in the first apparatus. 
                        The exposition of the data usually begins with the translation of <abbr>M</abbr> and with the list of witnesses which support it (group <quote>I</quote>) 
                        and continues with the analysis of the variants of the other groups.
                        In the event that <abbr>M</abbr>'s reading is difficult or controversial, 
                        we give the translation that we believe is more probable or more widespread, 
                        referring to paragraph 2 for more detailed information.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        <term>Loci paralleli</term> (<abbr>loc</abbr>).
                        Here we list cases of variation that are similar to the one under examination,
                        and that may therefore be useful for the text-critical discussion. 
                        The parallel places of variation, here as well as in the other paragraphs, 
                        are active hyperlinks that bring the user upon clicking to the corresponding entries in the commentary.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        Proposed interpretations (<abbr>ex</abbr>).
                        This paragraph is dedicated to proposals for the interpretation and translation of <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                        when its meaning is obscure and debated. 
                        Occasionally, readings of the other witnesses may also be discussed.                        
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        Proposed reconstructions and evaluations (<abbr>Vor</abbr>). 
                        Here we review the reconstructions of the textual history performed by other scholars, 
                        with a particular focus on the tradition of <abbr>G</abbr>, of the Revisors, and of <abbr>P</abbr>. 
                        We lay out any possible problems concerning transmission of the text 
                        and the decisions made by each editor as to the various textual traditions. 
                        Finally, we list, when present, the various proposals for retroversion.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        Proposed emendations and conjectures (<abbr>em</abbr>).
                        In this paragraph we present emendations and conjectures to the text, 
                        trying to highlight the various arguments that the authors have adduced for or against a given proposal for correction.
                    </item>
                    <item>
                        Textual choice (<abbr>cst</abbr>).
                        This is the place assigned to our textual decision, which ideally follows from the discussion of the previous paragraphs.
                        Here we first express our opinion on the existence of possible <term>Vorlagen</term> competing with <abbr>M</abbr>, 
                        and then we establish the text of the Archetype and finally of the Original. 
                        When this paragraph is absent and no preference of variants is expressed in the apparatus of the edition,
                        it means that we judge the variants to be indifferent.

            <head type="title">The Critical Text</head>
            <p>
                The critical text embodies our reconstruction of the author's Original. 
                The text, as we have indicated above, presents a normalised Hebrew spelling (§ <ptr target="#subsub-spelling"/>)
                and contains the pointing only if there are variants concerning it in the apparatus (§ <ptr target="#subsub-pointing"/>). 
                Apart from the indication of the chapters, each preceded by a heading,
                it runs continuously, without distinction between parts in poetry and parts in prose (§ <ptr target="#subsub-mise-en-page"/>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Words with normalised spelling are signalled by an empty <term>circellus</term> placed above
                which is reminescent of the system of the Masora
                (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <hi rend="stackon"><foreign xml:lang="hb">בירושלים</foreign></hi> in <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-1-a"/>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In the left margin of the critical text we report the numbering of the lines, 
                in order to offer a reference system for pointing out the variants in the apparatus (§ <ptr target="#sect-crit-app"/>). 
                The choice of using the line number, routine, for example, for the Latin and Greek classics,
                instead of the chapter and verse number, as is usual for the editions of the <abbr>HB</abbr>,
                is deliberate: the numbering of chapters and verses is a system 
                that is not only late but also foreign to the history of the biblical text in Hebrew.
                The numbering of chapters and verses is however maintained in the text, 
                so as to allow easier navigation as well as a comparison with the data shown in the collation.
            </p>      
            <p>
                The presence of variants in the text is evidenced by using the same superscript vowel-based system
                used for the collation (§ <ptr target="#subsect-lemma"/>).
                When a variant is incorporated into the text, the Latin letters are underlined
                (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <hi rend="supMath"><hi rend="underline">a</hi></hi><foreign xml:lang="hb">עמל</foreign> in
                <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-3-a"/>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In each verse, the order in which the Latin letters appear may be discontinuous: 
                this is due to the fact that not all the variants collected in the collation were mentioned in the critical edition. 
                This discontinuity has been left in place, in order to reveal the effects of the choice of variants in the edition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Omissions are marked by a longish horizontal stroke  (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> 
                <quote><hi rend="supMath"><hi rend="underline">f</hi></hi><foreign xml:lang="hb">—</foreign></quote> in 
                <ptr type="app" target="#app-2-12-f"/>).
                When a reading is corrupted, we place it between <term>cruces</term>,
                while if we believe it is not authorial, we expunge it using square brackets.
            </p>

        <div type="section" xml:id="sect-crit-app">
            <head type="title">The Critical Apparatus</head>
            <p>
                As we have more than once mentioned, 
                we include in the critical apparatus only some of the variants presented and discussed in the Collation. 
                We exclude all non-variants independent of <term>Vorlage</term>, 
                but also textual variants that we judge as unquestionably secondary and irrelevant to the history of the text, 
                such as certain <term>lectiones singulares</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the variants cited in the apparatus (except obviously the omissions) are in Hebrew. 
                The critical apparatus is therefore entirely monolingual. 
                We are aware that this is not the common practice today:
                current critical editions usually propose a mixture of readings in Hebrew and readings in the original language of the <abbr>Versions</abbr>,
                whereas  the <abbr>BHQ</abbr> has decided to free its critical apparatus of retroversions altogether, 
                relegating them to commentary footnotes. 
                Our decision to reproduce only Hebrew variants, indicating their degree of probability, is deliberate, 
                and derives not only from the fact that, in our specific case, the readings in their original languages can be found in the collation,
                but also from a basic methodological conviction: however conjectural,
                the retroversions remain an indispensable phase of the work of reconstruction,
                and should not be bypassed if one wants to present the material as unambiguously and completely as possible.
                <!--by eliminating them from the critical apparatus, the scholar does not really abstain from judgement; 
                rather, he hides it, making his thought opaque for the reader.-->
            </p>            
            <p>
                The critical apparatus consists of two basic parts: the lemma and the list of variants. 
                The apparatus is positive,
                meaning that we report in full both the witnesses which support the lemma and those which diverge from it. 
                Only the witnesses of the indeterminate readings are excluded.
            </p>
            <div type="subsection">
                <head type="title">The Lemma</head>
                <p>
                    The lemma in the apparatus is connected to the critical text, as stated above,
                    through the line numbers and through Latin letters placed in superscript.
                    It can consist of: (1) the <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> reading; (2) an emendation; and (3) a conjecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first two cases, the Hebrew lemma is immediately followed by the symbols of the witnesses which support it. 
                    To avoid redundancies, we do not always report the <term>siglum</term> <quote><abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr></quote>. 
                    Thus, the lemma <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך בירושלם</foreign> T]</quote> in
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-1-a"/> should be read as if it were
                    <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך בירושלם</foreign> <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> T].</quote>
                    We report the <term>siglum</term> <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr> only when <abbr>M</abbr> is isolated, 
                    <abbr>i.e.</abbr>, when it is not possible to identify witnesses that support it, 
                    as in <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">הקהלת</foreign> <abbr>M<hi rend="sup">L</hi></abbr>]</quote> in
                    <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-2-a"/>.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    The spelling of the reading in the critical text and the spelling of the lemma in the apparatus can sometimes differ,
                    as we have anticipated (§ <ptr target="#subsub-spelling"/>),
                    due to graphic normalisation: 
                    this can be seen in the first of the examples shown, where to the lemma reported in the critical apparatus 
                    <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך בירושלם</foreign>]</quote>
                    corresponds the normalised spelling of the critical text <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">מלך <hi rend="stackon">בירושים</hi></foreign>.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event that the lemma is made up of a conjecture (third case),
                    the Hebrew reading is followed by the bibliographic source from which the conjecture is taken
                    (the first, in chronological order). An example is <quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">מַעֲשֵׂי</foreign> Euringer (1890) ]</quote>
                    in <ptr type="app" target="#app-5-5-b"/>.
                    When the conjecture is ours (<ptr type="app" target="#app-10-5-b"/>, <ptr type="app" target="#app-10-5-c"/>), 
                    the lemma is followed by the notation <quote><hi rend="italics">ct</hi></quote>.
                    If the conjecture is opposed to the whole tradition, as in the cases just mentioned,
                    the transmitted reading is followed by the notation <quote><hi rend="italics">rel</hi></quote>, 
                    for Latin <hi xml:lang="lat">reliqui</hi>, <quote>the others</quote> (witnesses).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the critical text, when the reading in the lemma of the apparatus is an emendation or a conjecture,
                    it is indicated by underlined Latin letters (<ptr target="#subset-critical-text"/>).
                </p>

            <div type="subsection" xml:id="subsect-variants">
                <head type="title">The Variants</head>
                <p>
                    The lemma is followed by the variants, each separated by a vertical bar (<quote>|</quote>). 
                    The variants, as we have said, are in Hebrew, both for the direct sources
                    (Qumran and the medieval manuscripts) and for the indirect sources (the <abbr>Versions</abbr>). 
                    In the latter case, we use for the reconstructed <term>Vorlagen</term> 
                    the identical conventions employed in the collation (§ <ptr target="#subsect-var-non-var"/>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <term>sigla</term> for the witnesses are substantially the same as those used in the collation,
                    but the list of these in our apparatus is much less detailed: 
                    if a tradition unanimously attests a variant, we use the main <term>siglum</term> of that tradition (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <quote><abbr>G</abbr></quote>);
                    if only part of the tradition has the variant,
                    we add a superscript <hi rend="sup">Mss</hi> to that <term>siglum</term>  (<quote><abbr>G<hi rend="sup">Mss</hi></abbr></quote>);
                    if the tradition is split and it is possible to reconstruct the original, 
                    this is marked with an asterisk (<quote><abbr>OG</abbr></quote>).
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Of the medieval manuscripts and of the printed editions we do not report the <term>sigla</term>, but the total, for each category: 
                    we have not taken this decision without regret, but, in the absence of a reliable <term>stemma</term>, this is an obligatory choice. 
                    The complete lists can in any event be consulted in the collation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As regards the reconstruction of the relationships among witnesses (§ <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/>),
                    we were confronted with two possible choices:
                    to eliminate them altogether from the critical apparatus by way of <term>eliminatio descriptorum</term>,
                    as the editors of the HBCE recommend 
                    <note type="foot">
                        See <ref target="#Hendel2013">77</ref>.
                    </note>; 
                    and to report them, by signalling their status as <term>descripti</term> with a special notation.
                    We regard the first option as the most correct philologically and also as the most compact aesthetically. 
                    We have taken the last path, because we wanted to keep our apparatus positive.
                </p>       
                <p>
                    At the beginning of each apparatus entry, before displaying the lemma, 
                    we print the number of the chapter and verse in which that apparatus entry is found, 
                    so as to allow for easier navigation of the apparatus. 
                    Such numbers are hyperlinks referring back to the collation,
                    which can be consulted and checked.
                    To alert the reader to the presence of a commentary note, 
                    we use the arrow <quote><hi rend="supMath"><metamark rend="nearrow">↖</metamark></hi></quote> placed at the end of the apparatus entry. 
                    This symbol is also a hyperlink, leading to the corresponding note in the commentary.

            <div type="subsection" xml:id="subsect-evaluations">
                <head type="title">Evalutations</head>
                <p>
                    The lemma and the variants can be followed, immediately after the list of witnesses, 
                    by two types of critical evaluations: 
                    (1) judgements on originality, which specify <hi rend="italics">why</hi> we decide to incorporate a certain variant into the text; 
                    and (2) characterisations, which specify <hi rend="italics">how</hi> a particular variant originated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The judgements, which follow the lemma and are enclosed in curly brackets,
                    correspond to the external and internal evaluation criteria 
                    discussed in Sections <ptr target="#subsect-external-crit"/> and <ptr target="#subsect-internal-criteria"/>. 
                    The characterisations, which follow the variants and are enclosed in normal parentheses, 
                    correspond to the values discussed in Section <ptr target="#subsect-characterisation"/>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid redundancy, judgements are not made explicit if they can be derived from characterisations. 
                    To give an example, if a variant is characterised as <term>lectio facilior</term>, 
                    it is clear that the rival variant will be accepted as a text because it is, if nothing else, <term>difficilior</term>. 
                    The judgement <quote><hi rend="esc">{</hi>B<hi rend="esc">}</hi></quote> is therefore implicitly attributed to this variant. 
                    Similarly, if one variant is preferred to another which is characterised as an assimilation (<quote>assim</quote>), 
                    then it will automatically receive the qualification of <term>non-assimilating</term> (<quote><hi rend="esc">{</hi>B<hi rend="sup">1</hi><hi rend="esc">}</hi></quote>); 
                    if a variant is preferred to an ideological or theological interpolation  (<quote>ideol,</quote> <quote>theol</quote>), 
                    it will receive the judgement as the reading most in line with the Author's thought (<quote><hi rend="esc">{</hi>F<hi rend="esc">}</hi></quote>); and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a rule, as has been said, judgements accompany the lemmas, and characterisations are associated with variants. 
                    In those cases where a textual reading is met with reservations, however, 
                    we follow up the lemma with a characterisation to make those reservations explicit. 
                    An example is in <ptr type="app" target="#app-1-3-b"/>, where the lemma <foreign xml:lang="hb">השמש</foreign> is accepted as text, 
                    but with a suspicion of being an assimilation, thus: ‘<quote><foreign xml:lang="hb">השמש</foreign> G P Jer T (assim?) ].</quote>

            <p>
                In translating the critical text we have tried to remain faithful to the letter of the Hebrew Original that we have reconstructed. 
                We have therefore limited the exegetical and explanatory interventions as much as possible, 
                aiming not for elegance or even semantic appropriateness,
                but for lexical consistency and quantitative Hebrew-English correspondence: 
                this means that for each Hebrew word <hi rend="italics">n</hi> we try to only ever match a single English word <hi rend="italics">n<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>,
                in order to offer guidance to the reader of the critical text.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the same reason we have included in the translation the editorial interventions of the critical text, 
                indicating in the same way corrections, corruptions, and expunctions (see § <ptr target="#subset-critical-text"/>). 
                Corrupted parts, if they are <term>hapax</term>, are transliterated , otherwise they are translated verbatim, 
                in such a way as to give an idea of the difficulties involved. 
                We have also wanted to point out in the translation those parts of the text which,
                although supported by tradition, are difficult and doubtful, placing them between superscript question marks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have maintained the traditional division into verses, even when we believe this to be erroneous: 
                to signal changes in the textual flow, we have used punctuation.
